1
00:00:44,353 --> 00:00:46,844
We can't hold out much longer, sir.

2
00:01:14,917 --> 00:01:18,011
General Hummel, you've got
to get us out of here now!

3
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,248
I won't let you down.
I won't let you down, son.

4
00:01:26,095 --> 00:01:28,928
Goddamn it, sir!
How long do we have to wait?

5
00:01:29,031 --> 00:01:30,931
I've lost 15 men already!

6
00:01:31,033 --> 00:01:34,196
Sir, they're lighting us up
like a firestorm!

7
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:37,431
This is Gen. Hummel.
You gotta get my men outta there!

8
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,202
We don't have clearance
to go behind enemy lines, sir.

9
00:01:43,112 --> 00:01:46,013
They're not comin '
for us, are they, sir?

10
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:59,120
Congressman Weaver and esteemed members
of the Special Armed Services Committee,

11
00:01:59,228 --> 00:02:02,527
I come before you
to protest a grave injustice.

12
00:02:12,374 --> 00:02:15,537
Aim!

13
00:02:15,644 --> 00:02:18,807
It has to stop.

14
00:03:01,991 --> 00:03:04,323
I miss you so much.

15
00:03:14,203 --> 00:03:16,933
There's somethin'
I've gotta do, Barb.

16
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,270
Somethin' I couldn't do
while you were here.

17
00:03:20,376 --> 00:03:22,640
I tried.

18
00:03:22,745 --> 00:03:27,307
You know I tried everything,
and I still don't have their attention.

19
00:03:29,218 --> 00:03:32,984
Let's hope this elevates
their thinking.

20
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:35,579
But whatever happens...

21
00:03:37,726 --> 00:03:39,956
please don't think less of me.

22
00:04:22,538 --> 00:04:26,702
Marine!. Inform the garrison C.O.
that Gen. Hummel's coming on board...

23
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:29,243
- with a security inspection team.
- Yes, sir.

24
00:04:29,345 --> 00:04:32,212
Sir, it's an honor having you, sir.

25
00:04:46,962 --> 00:04:49,089
Aah!

26
00:04:57,806 --> 00:05:01,298
- Uuh!
- Oof!

27
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,708
Ya know, at least we can get some-

28
00:05:06,982 --> 00:05:12,045
- Yeah, I'll tell ya- Uuh!
- Ooh!

29
00:05:12,154 --> 00:05:15,954
Aah! Aah!

30
00:05:16,058 --> 00:05:17,582
Uuh!

31
00:05:22,331 --> 00:05:26,791
I got the access card. We got
30 minutes 'til those darts wear off.

32
00:05:26,902 --> 00:05:28,369
Move it!

33
00:05:32,174 --> 00:05:34,074
The access card, sir.

34
00:05:36,645 --> 00:05:38,340
Let's do it.

35
00:05:43,185 --> 00:05:46,086
Twenty-four hundred
magazine check.

36
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,300
- Man, it's wet out there.
- Check me through, will ya?.

37
00:06:14,116 --> 00:06:16,641
Clear!

38
00:06:42,845 --> 00:06:45,473
- I want 16, Major.
- Move it!

39
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,737
- Evac! Seal the door!
- No! No!

40
00:07:15,844 --> 00:07:18,176
Come on, man, seal it! Seal it!

41
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,840
No-o-o!

42
00:07:22,851 --> 00:07:25,547
Lemme outta here! Oh, God!
Lemme outta here! Oh, God!

43
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:27,747
Lemme outta here! God!

44
00:07:27,856 --> 00:07:31,917
Clear out.
Get outta here!

45
00:07:35,297 --> 00:07:39,734
- Please!
- Sorry.

46
00:07:46,975 --> 00:07:48,966
Let's move out.

47
00:08:00,556 --> 00:08:03,081
Two more CCs of acetylene chloride.

48
00:08:05,827 --> 00:08:08,455
That'll be five dollars,
Isherwood.

49
00:08:08,564 --> 00:08:11,294
You suck.

50
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,465
You guys have too much time
on your hands.

51
00:08:20,576 --> 00:08:24,910
Yes! She's here.
Bring it to me now. Thank you, Phil.

52
00:08:25,013 --> 00:08:27,504
What's that?
Why'd you get it sent here?

53
00:08:27,616 --> 00:08:32,519
Carla wouldn't approve. She thinks
it's dumb to spend $600 on an L.P.

54
00:08:32,621 --> 00:08:36,614
Carla's right. Why don't you just
spend $ 13.00 on a CD, man?

55
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:39,193
First of all,
it's because I'm a Beatle maniac.

56
00:08:39,294 --> 00:08:41,660
And second, these sound better.

57
00:08:41,763 --> 00:08:44,357
Could be serious.

58
00:08:44,466 --> 00:08:46,832
Could be sarin gas.

59
00:08:49,271 --> 00:08:52,035
Dog out at J.F.K. caught a whiff
of something in this package...

60
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,040
postmarked
to a Bosnian refugee camp.

61
00:08:54,142 --> 00:08:56,975
It could be detergent;
it could be sarin gas.

62
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:58,979
Bosnian refugee camp?.

63
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:02,380
Half a million Serbians reside in
the U.S. Serbians don't like Bosnians.

64
00:09:02,484 --> 00:09:04,748
You guys wanna get suited up?.

65
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:11,416
- Bring the cockroaches?.
- Got 'em.

66
00:09:11,526 --> 00:09:13,619
We have airlock, Stanley.
You're all set to go.

67
00:09:18,533 --> 00:09:22,435
October 1, 0900 hours.

68
00:09:22,537 --> 00:09:26,268
Agent Stanley Goodspeed,
Agent Trainee Marvin Isherwood...

69
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,502
initiating exam of wooden crate.

70
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,376
Suspicion of sarin gas inside.

71
00:09:32,481 --> 00:09:34,642
- Marvin, sarin is a-
- G.B. aerosol.

72
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,242
That is correct.
I see we have some dirty magazines.

73
00:09:38,353 --> 00:09:41,550
Stone Age Cave girls In the Raw.
Kinky.

74
00:09:41,657 --> 00:09:45,024
And, uh- Not a good sign.

75
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:49,029
Helloo-oo-oo, little baby doll.
Look it, Stan.

76
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:52,623
- Hi, there, Stanley!
- Marvin, don't!

77
00:09:52,734 --> 00:09:54,326
Hiya, Stan!

78
00:09:54,436 --> 00:09:58,099
Shit! Move back!
Move back!

79
00:09:58,206 --> 00:10:00,766
- Power landings offed.
- Hang on, guys.

80
00:10:00,876 --> 00:10:03,276
We'll have that room cleared
in 50 seconds. You're going to be okay.

81
00:10:03,378 --> 00:10:05,676
Jesus Christ!

82
00:10:05,781 --> 00:10:09,478
Okay, I've got some bad news
and some really bad news.

83
00:10:09,584 --> 00:10:13,953
The bad news is that the gas is
corrosive and it's eating our suits.

84
00:10:14,056 --> 00:10:17,150
- It's all over my hand, man.
- The really bad news...

85
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:20,956
is there's enough C-4 explosive and
poison gas to blow the whole chamber...

86
00:10:21,063 --> 00:10:22,963
- and kill everybody in the building.
- Detonation too heavy.

87
00:10:23,065 --> 00:10:25,329
- Everybody, out of the room, now!
- Seal us inside.

88
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:32,162
Where are the sprinklers,
Lonner?.

89
00:10:32,274 --> 00:10:37,143
The acid's eating my su- It's eating
my fucking suit, all right?. Shit.

90
00:10:37,245 --> 00:10:40,646
Just wash us off..
Where are my sprinklers?

91
00:10:40,749 --> 00:10:42,580
We're working on it.
It’s just a flow problem.

92
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:45,278
Well, it's a pretty big friggin'
problem, Lonner. Fix it now!

93
00:10:45,387 --> 00:10:47,582
We're working on it! How much time
do you have on that detonator?.

94
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,623
- A minute, ten.
- Hey, look at this!

95
00:10:49,725 --> 00:10:52,125
We're gonna have the room clear.

96
00:10:52,227 --> 00:10:54,218
- Tell 'em to take the atropine, now.
- The atropine, Isherwood.

97
00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:56,991
- What?.
- Where's my water?. One minute!

98
00:10:57,099 --> 00:11:01,661
Marvin, the atropine! Inject it
in your heart before your suit melts.

99
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:04,000
Shh-it!

100
00:11:04,106 --> 00:11:07,598
- Make him take his dose!
- Where's that water?

101
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:12,510
- Get that away from me!
- Come on, Phil, fix it, for Christ's sake!

102
00:11:12,614 --> 00:11:16,482
-Take the atropine now, Stan, for Christ's sake!
-We're fucked.

103
00:11:16,585 --> 00:11:20,316
- Poison's mixing.
- What the fuck are you waiting for?.

104
00:11:20,422 --> 00:11:24,483
- You take the fucking needle now!
- Fucking shit, oh fucking shit-

105
00:11:24,593 --> 00:11:27,061
- Forty seconds!
- If that suit melts-

106
00:11:27,162 --> 00:11:29,528
If you die, we all die!
Inject your heart...

107
00:11:29,631 --> 00:11:32,031
- and then diff. use the bomb!
- Come on, just do it, Stan!

108
00:11:32,134 --> 00:11:34,625
Shit, what if I miss my heart?.
I can't see shit!

109
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:37,227
- Do it now!
- Look how big this is.

110
00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:41,002
You want me to stick this into
my heart?. Are you fucking nuts?.

111
00:11:41,109 --> 00:11:43,270
The sprinkler's coming.
It's coming.

112
00:11:43,378 --> 00:11:45,642
Okay, here we go, man!

113
00:11:48,216 --> 00:11:50,184
Sprinkler activated!

114
00:11:50,285 --> 00:11:52,219
How much time left?.

115
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,380
Twenty seconds.

116
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,685
We're not gonna make it.

117
00:11:57,793 --> 00:12:00,956
Fifteen.

118
00:12:03,832 --> 00:12:05,732
Oh, come on!

119
00:12:05,834 --> 00:12:08,132
Clear!

120
00:12:10,238 --> 00:12:12,604
Get me the fuck out
of this gas chamber.

121
00:12:12,707 --> 00:12:15,699
I almost stabbed myself
in the heart with this thing!

122
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,346
- Stan?.
- Hey, darlin'.

123
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:25,147
Hi, baby.

124
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,649
I had such
an interesting day today.

125
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:33,523
Yeah, I had kind of
an interesting day myself.

126
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:36,688
Okay, you go first.

127
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:40,757
Oh, just some terrorists decide to send
a little care package- box o' goodies-

128
00:12:40,869 --> 00:12:45,431
- which had to be neutralized
before blowing up the office.

129
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,805
So, I took the rest of the day off.
Glass of wine, a little guitar-

130
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:52,038
- Just relaxing.
- Wow.

131
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:55,844
The world is being
Fed-Ex'd to hell on a handcart.

132
00:12:55,951 --> 00:12:59,409
I believe that anyone who's thinking
about having a child in this world...

133
00:12:59,521 --> 00:13:02,615
is coldly considering
an act of cruelty.

134
00:13:02,724 --> 00:13:07,252
I know, I'm rambling, I'm complaining,
I'm sorry. What's your news, baby?.

135
00:13:07,362 --> 00:13:10,923
- I'm pregnant.
- I'm sorry?.

136
00:13:11,032 --> 00:13:13,466
I'm pregnant.

137
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,401
- Really?.
- Yeah.

138
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:23,137
- Wow.
- Is that all you're gonna say, "wow"?.

139
00:13:23,245 --> 00:13:25,736
- You're pregnant?.
- Three weeks.

140
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:28,042
How do you know?.
I mean, h-how do you know?.

141
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:31,778
Blue.

142
00:13:31,887 --> 00:13:34,822
just turned blue,
so I went to the doctor.

143
00:13:34,923 --> 00:13:37,949
- Well, you didn't mean what you just said, did you?
- When?.

144
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:40,527
just right now, when you were talking
about bringing a child into the world...

145
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:44,429
- and having it be an act of... cruelty.
- I meant it at the time.

146
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:47,229
Stanley, at the time?. You said
it seven and a half seconds ago.

147
00:13:47,335 --> 00:13:53,103
Well... gosh, kind of a lot's happened
since then. We're not even married.

148
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:56,268
I know. It's funny
you should mention that.

149
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:59,176
- It's funny?.
- Do you love me?.

150
00:13:59,281 --> 00:14:02,648
- Of course I love you.
- Good.

151
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:10,855
- Will you marry me?. - Whoa, whoa,
hey- Marriage Police, pull over.

152
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,292
Come on, Stanley.
I'm proposing to you right now.

153
00:14:23,271 --> 00:14:27,799
The Rock is the most famous and
was the most feared prison ever built.

154
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:30,742
Is it really true that there's
never been an escape?.

155
00:14:30,845 --> 00:14:34,838
Ah, that's true. From 1936
until '63 when the prison closed,

156
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,850
there were 14 attempts.

157
00:14:36,952 --> 00:14:40,979
No one is believed to have made it
to shore- alive, at least.

158
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:46,121
Uh, hey, hey, fellas. I'm sorry,
but tourists are not allowed back here.

159
00:14:46,227 --> 00:14:48,320
I don't really give a shit.
You give a shit?.

160
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,864
- No. Come here, fruity.
- Move!

161
00:14:50,966 --> 00:14:54,925
-Hey,girls?. Hi. You all havin' a good time?.
-Yeah.

162
00:14:55,036 --> 00:14:58,005
Will you do something for me?.
It's really - It's really important.

163
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:01,371
I need you to tell your teacher that you need
to get back on the boat and go home right now.

164
00:15:01,476 --> 00:15:04,968
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Broadway!

165
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,412
This cell block housed...

166
00:15:07,515 --> 00:15:11,007
the most awesome scum
in America.

167
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:15,078
Ladies and gentlemen, I, Ranger Bob,
cordially invite you...

168
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:18,489
to become inmates of Alcatraz-
temporarily, of course, heh!

169
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:23,594
On line!

170
00:15:25,266 --> 00:15:28,167
Pretty tight quarters,
aren't they, huh?

171
00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:30,635
Like being a caged animal.

172
00:15:30,739 --> 00:15:34,004
Spend a couple of years in there-
What's the matter, fellas?.

173
00:15:34,109 --> 00:15:36,669
- Something wrong with the tour?.
- Tour's over, Bob.

174
00:15:42,951 --> 00:15:46,182
What kind of
fucked-up tour is this?.

175
00:15:59,968 --> 00:16:03,028
Gen. Hummel, Captains Frye
and Darrow reporting, sir.

176
00:16:03,138 --> 00:16:06,801
Welcome to the Rock, gentlemen. Land the
choppers on the back side and deploy as planned.

177
00:16:06,908 --> 00:16:09,274
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Aye, aye, sir. Move out!

178
00:16:09,377 --> 00:16:11,436
I'm not allowed
to carry a gun!

179
00:16:11,546 --> 00:16:14,310
Oh, you're not allowed to carry a gun?.
I got a goddamned gun!

180
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:18,045
If I’d had known this was gonna happen,
I'd have brought my motherfuckin' gun!

181
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:20,321
Help!

182
00:16:20,388 --> 00:16:24,586
All right, this'll be our new home.
Tom, I want a command center right here.

183
00:16:32,834 --> 00:16:34,825
- I want coms up.
- Roger that, sir.

184
00:16:34,936 --> 00:16:39,305
Put the satellite over there.
I want to be up at 1600.

185
00:16:39,407 --> 00:16:41,500
Let's move it.

186
00:16:49,284 --> 00:16:52,082
Systems up.

187
00:16:52,187 --> 00:16:56,681
Possible penetration point in shower
room. We're setting anti-intrusion.

188
00:16:56,791 --> 00:17:00,784
I brought a personal touch, sir.
It's an anti-motion trembler device.

189
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:05,298
It's custom-made. Nobody knows
about it, and nobody expects it.

190
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,699
- What's it do?.
- We head-fake 'em with the laser beam,

191
00:17:08,803 --> 00:17:12,830
and then if they disturb Mr. Backup
here... we own 'em.

192
00:17:25,987 --> 00:17:30,048
Ladies and gentlemen, you're
being detained against your will.

193
00:17:30,158 --> 00:17:34,686
For that I apologize. It is not
our intention in anyway to harm you.

194
00:17:34,796 --> 00:17:39,130
You will not be detained one minute longer than
is necessary for us to complete our mission.

195
00:17:44,506 --> 00:17:47,031
Attention on deck!

196
00:17:47,142 --> 00:17:50,407
Stand easy, men.

197
00:17:50,512 --> 00:17:55,711
Make no mistake about it, gentlemen.
We are now in harm's way.

198
00:17:55,817 --> 00:17:58,911
For Major Baxter and I, this is the last
campaign in a career dating back...

199
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,113
to Tet '68.

200
00:18:01,222 --> 00:18:04,419
Likewise for Captain Hendrix
and Gunnery Sergeant Crisp,

201
00:18:04,526 --> 00:18:08,257
who cut their teeth
under my command in Desert Storm.

202
00:18:08,363 --> 00:18:12,527
Capt. Frye, Capt. Darrow, this is
my first operational situation with you,

203
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:14,829
and I have to say thus far your conduct
reflects your reputations.

204
00:18:14,936 --> 00:18:16,870
- Thank you, General.
- Thank you, sir.

205
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:20,270
We have achieved our position
through poise, precision and audacity.

206
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,605
To this we must now add resolve.

207
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:26,168
We'll be branded as traitors;
the gravest capitol crime.

208
00:18:26,281 --> 00:18:28,749
Punishable by death.

209
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:34,379
Couple hundred years ago, a few guys
named Washington, Jefferson and Adams...

210
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:37,652
were branded as traitors
by the British.

211
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:40,694
And now they're called patriots.

212
00:18:40,795 --> 00:18:42,786
In time, so shall we.

213
00:18:44,699 --> 00:18:48,692
God willing, in less than 48 hours, we
will evacuate this island in gunships...

214
00:18:48,803 --> 00:18:52,204
under cover of hostages
and V.X. gas warheads.

215
00:18:52,307 --> 00:18:55,868
Your destination:
a nonextradition-treaty country.

216
00:18:55,977 --> 00:19:00,141
You will each be paid a fee
of $1 million for services rendered.

217
00:19:00,248 --> 00:19:04,810
But you can never again
set foot on your native soil.

218
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:08,377
- Can you live with that?.
- Yes, sir!

219
00:19:08,489 --> 00:19:11,219
The men of Marine Force Recon
are selected...

220
00:19:11,326 --> 00:19:15,422
to carry out illegal operations
throughout the world.

221
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:18,226
When they don't come home...

222
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:21,268
their families are told fairy tales
about what happened to them...

223
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:24,566
and denied compensation.

224
00:19:24,672 --> 00:19:28,108
Well, I have choked
on these lies my entire career.

225
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:30,677
Well, here and now
the lies stop!

226
00:19:36,517 --> 00:19:40,248
God be with all of you.
Man your positions, men.

227
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:46,587
This is FBI Director Womack.

228
00:19:46,694 --> 00:19:50,152
Director... be advised,

229
00:19:50,265 --> 00:19:53,063
81... I say again,

230
00:19:53,167 --> 00:19:57,001
81 civilians are under my control
as of this moment.

231
00:19:57,105 --> 00:20:01,337
You are to take measures to assure this
remains a need-to-know classified fact.

232
00:20:01,442 --> 00:20:05,640
-Who is this?.
-Mr. Director, you have a very serious problem.

233
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:08,875
A battery of V.X. gas rockets
is presently deployed to deliver...

234
00:20:08,983 --> 00:20:13,682
a highly-lethal strike on the population
of the San Francisco Bay area.

235
00:20:13,788 --> 00:20:15,688
I will call again at 0100 hours
to state my demands.

236
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:18,350
- I wanna know who I'm talking to.
- This is Brigadier General...

237
00:20:18,459 --> 00:20:22,862
Francis X. Hummel, United States
Marine Corps from Alcatraz... out.

238
00:20:23,965 --> 00:20:26,456
I'll cancel your reservations.

239
00:20:26,567 --> 00:20:30,003
Get the Pentagon
and call the San Francisco office.

240
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:33,096
It seems Alcatraz
was just reopened.

241
00:20:33,207 --> 00:20:37,143
Last night, Gen. Hummel using
brutal but non lethal force...

242
00:20:37,245 --> 00:20:39,236
under the guise of
a security exercise,

243
00:20:39,347 --> 00:20:42,475
walked off with 15
V.X. poison-gas rockets.

244
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:44,551
He lost one of his own men
in the process.

245
00:20:44,652 --> 00:20:48,383
That's Gen. Hummel in Vietnam.
I think he was a major at the time.

246
00:20:48,489 --> 00:20:52,687
Three tours in Vietnam,
Panama, Grenada, Desert Storm;

247
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:57,595
Three Purple Hearts, two Silver Stars
and the Congressional Medal of-

248
00:20:57,699 --> 00:21:01,100
Jesus. This man is a hero.

249
00:21:01,202 --> 00:21:03,397
Well, I think " legend" might be
a better description, Mr. Sinclair.

250
00:21:03,504 --> 00:21:07,201
Well, now we can add kidnapping
and extortion to his list of accolades.

251
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:09,435
Mr. Sinclair,
Gen. Hummel is a man of honor.

252
00:21:11,012 --> 00:21:12,741
General, it's him.

253
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:18,475
- Frank, it's Al Kramer.
- Hi, Al. How ya doin'?.

254
00:21:18,586 --> 00:21:21,214
I don't know, Frank.
Why don't you tell me?.

255
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:24,120
There are a lot of very,
very worried people here, Frank.

256
00:21:24,225 --> 00:21:26,523
I'll come straight to the point.

257
00:21:26,627 --> 00:21:29,755
83 Force Reconnaissance Marines
have died under my various commands.

258
00:21:29,864 --> 00:21:32,128
47 in Northern Laos
and Southern China.

259
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:35,430
Southern China?. We never admitted
we sent troops into China.

260
00:21:35,536 --> 00:21:37,766
Who is this?.
Identify yourself.

261
00:21:37,872 --> 00:21:40,739
White House Chief of Staff
Hayden Sinclair, General.

262
00:21:40,842 --> 00:21:44,278
How old are you,
Chief of Staff Sinclair?.

263
00:21:44,379 --> 00:21:46,904
- I'm 33.
- Well, Mr. Sinclair,

264
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:50,075
you've probably got no fucking idea
what I'm talking about.

265
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:52,584
By your ninth birthday,
I was runnin' black ops into China,

266
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:55,451
and my men were responsible
for over 200 enemy kills.

267
00:21:55,556 --> 00:21:58,491
Now put some rigging tape
over Mr. Sinclair's mouth.

268
00:21:58,593 --> 00:22:01,994
- He's wasting my time.
- Ah, you want to continue, Frank?.

269
00:22:02,096 --> 00:22:04,291
Remember Operation Desert Storm?.

270
00:22:04,399 --> 00:22:08,130
Those surgical hits made by our
smart bombs covered so well on CNN?.

271
00:22:08,236 --> 00:22:12,900
It was my men on the ground that made
those hits possible by lasing the targets.

272
00:22:13,007 --> 00:22:16,408
Twenty of them were left to rot outside
Baghdad after the conflict ended.

273
00:22:16,511 --> 00:22:20,572
No benefits were paid to their families.
No medals conferred.

274
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:27,620
These men died for their country, and they
weren't even given a goddamn military burial.

275
00:22:29,123 --> 00:22:31,455
The situation is unacceptable.

276
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:34,153
You will transfer$100 million
from the Grand Cayman...

277
00:22:34,262 --> 00:22:37,163
Red Sea Trading Company account
to an account I designate.

278
00:22:37,265 --> 00:22:40,132
From these funds, reparations
of $ 1 million will be paid...

279
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:42,634
to each of
the 83 marines' families.

280
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:46,264
The rest of the funds
I will disperse at my discretion.

281
00:22:46,374 --> 00:22:48,535
Do I make myself clear?.

282
00:22:48,643 --> 00:22:52,010
Except for the Red Sea Trading Company.
What is that?.

283
00:22:52,113 --> 00:22:55,048
- Identify yourself.
- This is FBI Director Womack, General.

284
00:22:55,149 --> 00:22:58,778
It's a slush fund where the Pentagon
keeps proceeds from illegal arms sales.

285
00:22:58,886 --> 00:23:01,377
Jesus, Frank!
This is classified information.

286
00:23:01,489 --> 00:23:04,856
You alert the media,
I launch the gas.

287
00:23:04,959 --> 00:23:07,985
You refuse payment,
I launch the gas.

288
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:12,089
You've got 40 hours- 'til noon, day after
tomorrow- to arrange transfer of the money.

289
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,034
I am aware of your counter measure. You
know and I know it doesn't stand a chance.

290
00:23:16,137 --> 00:23:18,196
Hummel from Alcatraz, out.

291
00:23:20,007 --> 00:23:21,497
All right.

292
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:25,170
We have to identify the hostages
and contact each of their families.

293
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:28,874
Tell 'em somethin'. Make up a story,
and we've got to keep this undercover.

294
00:23:28,983 --> 00:23:33,181
If this comes out, the city of
San Francisco will be in chaos, anarchy.

295
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:36,745
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What is the potential casualty rate...

296
00:23:36,858 --> 00:23:41,557
for a single rocket armed
with V.X. poison gas, Gen. Peterson?.

297
00:23:41,662 --> 00:23:45,257
- Sixty or seventy.
- Well, that's not so bad.

298
00:23:45,366 --> 00:23:49,530
Thousand.
Seventy thousand dead.

299
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:52,265
- Oh.
- One teaspoon of this hits the floor,

300
00:23:52,373 --> 00:23:54,933
it's lethal up to... 100 feet.

301
00:23:55,042 --> 00:23:58,375
One teaspoon of this shit
detonated in the atmosphere...

302
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:01,744
will kill every living organism
in an eight-block radius.

303
00:24:01,849 --> 00:24:04,374
Get the point?.

304
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:07,318
What did Hummel mean by
your "counter measure," General?.

305
00:24:07,421 --> 00:24:11,016
Standard poison is countered by napalm.
It consumes it upon detonation.

306
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:15,186
Now, the problem with V.X.. poison gas
is that it's designed specifically...

307
00:24:15,296 --> 00:24:18,561
to withstand napalm; that's
where thermite plasma comes in.

308
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:21,965
- Gen. Peterson?.
- Thermite plasma incendiary systems...

309
00:24:22,069 --> 00:24:25,163
can burn hot enough to consume V.X..,
but they're still in the test phase.

310
00:24:25,273 --> 00:24:29,073
It's not operational.
Hummel knows this.

311
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:32,271
We are dealing with
one smart son of a bitch.

312
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,008
What's it gonna take
to equip a flight of F-18s...

313
00:24:35,116 --> 00:24:37,710
with thermite plasma
within the next 36 hours?.

314
00:24:37,818 --> 00:24:41,254
- An act of God.
- Excuse me?.

315
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:43,721
All right. We can try.

316
00:24:43,824 --> 00:24:47,726
But I strongly urge you to consider the
use of this as a secondary initiative.

317
00:24:47,828 --> 00:24:50,228
Then we have to go to our
primary initiative. Uh, Admiral?.

318
00:24:50,331 --> 00:24:53,823
Sir, I'd like to bring in our SEAL
ground commander, Cmdr. Anderson.

319
00:24:53,935 --> 00:24:58,634
Mr. Womack, who is your best
chemical/biological man?.

320
00:24:58,973 --> 00:25:01,134
That's interesting.

321
00:25:01,242 --> 00:25:04,177
- Oh, yeah.
- That's very compelling.

322
00:25:06,914 --> 00:25:09,474
Ahh, you like my pigtails?.

323
00:25:09,584 --> 00:25:12,576
Oh, yeah.
Pigtails are naughty.

324
00:25:12,687 --> 00:25:15,622
Naughty, naughty-

325
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:18,453
You're just an amaretto cream
with peach sorbet persuasion.

326
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:21,392
This isn't happening.

327
00:25:21,495 --> 00:25:23,793
- No, Stan. Don't answer it.
- This isn't happening!

328
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:26,366
- No, just don't answer it. It's okay.
- I have to.

329
00:25:26,467 --> 00:25:28,662
- It's the office, baby. They
know I'm home. - Oh-h-h-h!

330
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:32,603
- How could they possibly know that you're home?.
- It's the FBI.

331
00:25:35,543 --> 00:25:38,706
- Stanley! Tsk!
- Goodspeed.

332
00:25:38,813 --> 00:25:41,543
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I'll be-
I'll be down-

333
00:25:41,649 --> 00:25:44,675
- Yeah, downstairs in ten minutes.
- No, you won't.

334
00:25:46,787 --> 00:25:51,281
- I have to go to San Francisco.
- No, you don't.

335
00:25:51,392 --> 00:25:54,691
Stanley. No, you do not have
to go to San Francisco.

336
00:25:54,795 --> 00:25:57,525
Right now, you need to stay here
and talk to me about things.

337
00:25:57,632 --> 00:26:00,692
- I've got to go, baby.
- I am a Catholic.

338
00:26:00,801 --> 00:26:03,133
Do you realize that?.
I am pregnant, and I am unmarried...

339
00:26:03,237 --> 00:26:05,637
and this causes
a serious problem for me.

340
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,640
I cannot believe you.

341
00:26:16,817 --> 00:26:18,842
N- N-No.

342
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:22,480
I love you.

343
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:26,993
I will marry you.
I just didn't plan on this, that's all.

344
00:26:27,094 --> 00:26:30,029
Come to San Francisco.

345
00:26:30,131 --> 00:26:33,157
- Really?.
- Yeah. I'm sure it's just a training exercise.

346
00:26:33,267 --> 00:26:35,565
Check into the hotel,
order up some champagne-

347
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,797
- And we'll finish what we started?.
- Exactly.

348
00:26:37,905 --> 00:26:40,066
- Baby, you gonna marry me?.
- You know it.

349
00:26:40,174 --> 00:26:43,735
You're gonna marry me!
Oh, honey, come on.

350
00:26:43,844 --> 00:26:46,176
- Just a really quick one.
- Oh! Oh! I gotta go!

351
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,550
A nighttime airdrop incursion
is out, due to the full moon.

352
00:26:49,585 --> 00:26:51,677
Likewise,
a frontal seaside attack.

353
00:26:51,786 --> 00:26:54,721
If we’re compromised and shots
are fired, Hummel might launch.

354
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:57,518
Our only alternative is an attack
from within the prison.

355
00:26:57,625 --> 00:27:01,083
We penetrate the island through tunnels
under the prison buildings undetected...

356
00:27:01,195 --> 00:27:04,392
and emerge in its center; that way,
we can jump the marines from behind.

357
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:07,956
And if we're lucky, take their rocket
positions without a shot fired.

358
00:27:08,069 --> 00:27:10,731
I don't understand. You-You've
studied the architectural plans?.

359
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:14,569
They're useless. Alcatraz has been
ripped up and rebuilt for years.

360
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:17,701
- Under there is a maze of shit.
- There's no question, gentlemen.

361
00:27:17,812 --> 00:27:20,246
We need firsthand intelligence
of the tunnel systems.

362
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:23,613
- So what about the former warden?.
- Died in 1979.

363
00:27:23,718 --> 00:27:26,050
All the guards
we contacted were useless.

364
00:27:26,153 --> 00:27:30,351
Umm... there is someone who,
I think, can help us.

365
00:27:34,328 --> 00:27:36,228
This is for the sake
of national security.

366
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:40,664
No, it's the sake of national security that
got us here in the first place 33 years ago.

367
00:27:40,768 --> 00:27:44,135
I knew someday this would come back
to bite us. Forget it.

368
00:27:44,238 --> 00:27:47,366
- He does not exist.
- He does exist!

369
00:27:47,475 --> 00:27:51,002
We chose to forget him for 30 years.
We locked him up and threw away the key.

370
00:27:51,112 --> 00:27:53,205
Oh, and a lot of
goddamn good it did us.

371
00:27:53,314 --> 00:27:56,579
He broke out of two maximum security
prisons, and if he hits the streets-

372
00:27:56,684 --> 00:27:58,982
He's not gonna "hit the streets," Jim!

373
00:27:59,086 --> 00:28:02,078
Thirty years ago, he was
a highly-trained S.A.S. operative.

374
00:28:02,189 --> 00:28:06,956
He is my age now, for Christ's sake. I have
to get up three times a night to take a piss.

375
00:28:07,061 --> 00:28:09,495
We can't risk letting him out.

376
00:28:09,597 --> 00:28:12,930
He's a professional
escape artist.

377
00:28:44,632 --> 00:28:46,998
Oh, here he is now.

378
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:49,831
- Ah. Neat, uh-
- Yeah.

379
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:52,371
- Neat, neat plane.
- Dr. Goodspeed. James Womack.

380
00:28:52,473 --> 00:28:55,033
- Pleasure meeting you, sir. Thank you.
- Welcome.

381
00:28:55,142 --> 00:28:57,440
You come very highly recommended.
B.A., Columbia;

382
00:28:57,545 --> 00:28:59,604
M.A., PhD, Johns Hopkins.

383
00:28:59,713 --> 00:29:01,840
Biochemistry/toxicology?.

384
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:04,417
Well, I'm one of those fortunate people
who like my job, sir.

385
00:29:04,518 --> 00:29:07,419
Got my first chemistry set when
I was seven. Blew my eyebrows off.

386
00:29:07,521 --> 00:29:10,388
We never saw the cat again.
Been into it ever since.

387
00:29:10,491 --> 00:29:12,857
- What do you know about V.X. gas?.
- Liquid.

388
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,690
Failed pesticide discovered
by mistake in 1952.

389
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:18,663
Actually, it's like champagne that way.
The Franciscan monks thought...

390
00:29:18,766 --> 00:29:22,167
they were making white wine, somehow the
bottle carbonated, voila, champagne-

391
00:29:22,269 --> 00:29:25,727
- The gas, Dr. Goodspeed.
- It's very, very horrible, sir.

392
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,570
It's one of those things
we wish we could disinvent.

393
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:32,169
This isn't
a training exercise, is it?.

394
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:36,716
No, Dr. Goodspeed,
it's not a training exercise.

395
00:30:14,321 --> 00:30:16,221
- Ernest.
- Good morning, Director.

396
00:30:16,323 --> 00:30:18,757
This is Ernest Paxton, agent in charge
of the West Coast operation.

397
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:21,293
- Dr. Goodspeed.
- Pleasure to meet you.

398
00:30:21,395 --> 00:30:23,920
- How do you do, sir?.
- It's been a fairly interesting day so far.

399
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:26,226
The prison's here. Shall we?.

400
00:30:26,333 --> 00:30:29,769
Now, my boys, they haven't been
able to find a file on this guy.

401
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:32,498
- Who is he, anyway, sir?.
- His name is John Mason,

402
00:30:32,606 --> 00:30:36,474
a British national
incarcerated on Alcatraz in 1962;

403
00:30:36,577 --> 00:30:39,011
escaped in '63.

404
00:30:39,113 --> 00:30:43,641
- I was under the impression that no one escaped Alcatraz, sir.
- Paxton, don't argue!

405
00:30:43,751 --> 00:30:47,915
This man has no identity, not in
the United States or Great Britain.

406
00:30:48,022 --> 00:30:51,253
He does not exist. Understand?
I want one thing:

407
00:30:51,358 --> 00:30:55,317
how he escaped the rock- specifically,
how he took through the island's bowels.

408
00:30:55,429 --> 00:30:57,420
Papers are in order, sir.

409
00:30:57,531 --> 00:31:00,500
We're prepared to offer him
a full pardon.

410
00:31:00,601 --> 00:31:04,059
And Paxton, no strong-arming Mason.
I know him too well.

411
00:31:04,171 --> 00:31:06,935
Well, if you know him,
why don't you question him?.

412
00:31:07,041 --> 00:31:10,943
No. He'll remember me. I don't want
his anger clouding the issue.

413
00:31:11,045 --> 00:31:13,013
All right,
I'll take care of him.

414
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:25,157
Mr. Mason, I'm special agent
in charge Ernest Baxter.

415
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:29,992
In charge of what?. Fucking me over
for another three decades?.

416
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:33,066
I don't know anything about your
previous matters. I'm here because...

417
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:36,762
a special situation exists that we feel
you might be able to help us with.

418
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:40,397
Now, what might that be?. I've been
in jail longer than Nelson Mandela,

419
00:31:40,507 --> 00:31:42,839
so maybe you want me
to run for president.

420
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:46,037
- Not exactly.
- Ah, pity.

421
00:31:46,146 --> 00:31:49,411
- I feel rather like Alcamenes.
- Who?.

422
00:31:49,516 --> 00:31:52,883
Alcamenes. He was imprisoned
by his king in ancient Greece.

423
00:31:52,987 --> 00:31:55,979
Like Sir Walter Raleigh.
Same fate.

424
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:58,991
- James the First.
- Even someone as bright as you...

425
00:31:59,093 --> 00:32:03,325
must be aware that, uh, there's
a certain pattern emerging here.

426
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:07,264
- Alexander Solzhenitsyn?.
- Yeah, I heard of him.

427
00:32:07,368 --> 00:32:09,836
Didn't he play hockey
for the fuckin' Redwings?.

428
00:32:09,937 --> 00:32:12,428
- That's the chap.
- Get this straight, Pops.

429
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:14,871
I don't like you any more
than you like me.

430
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:17,375
But I'm here to make you
a legitimate off. er.

431
00:32:17,478 --> 00:32:19,673
You wanna hear
what I have to say or not?.

432
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:23,580
By all means,
dear Paxton, by all means.

433
00:32:23,684 --> 00:32:26,847
We got a problem in a place
that I think you know.

434
00:32:26,954 --> 00:32:29,582
There's a hostage situation
on Alcatraz.

435
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:33,387
- Hostage?.
- Eighty-one tourists.

436
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:36,588
The Rock has become
a tourist attraction?.

437
00:32:36,697 --> 00:32:40,428
Why don't we cut the shit, huh?
You know the Rock. You broke out.

438
00:32:40,534 --> 00:32:43,935
- Yes, successfully.
- Yeah.

439
00:32:44,038 --> 00:32:46,472
So why don't you do yourself a favor
while you're helpin' us.

440
00:32:46,573 --> 00:32:49,440
I mean, it'd be nice to get out of jail
while you're still vertical.

441
00:32:49,543 --> 00:32:52,706
Hmm?. While you got a little lead
left in your pencil?.

442
00:32:54,381 --> 00:32:57,214
While I'm considering
your offer,

443
00:32:57,317 --> 00:33:01,481
I want a suite
at the Fairmont Hotel.

444
00:33:01,588 --> 00:33:04,455
You know, I'm here
to cut you a deal.

445
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:08,892
I am not here to bend over
and take it up the ass from you.

446
00:33:08,996 --> 00:33:12,329
Here. Here's a quarter.

447
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:19,400
Do yourself a favor.
Call your lawyer.

448
00:33:19,506 --> 00:33:21,406
You're goin' back to jail.

449
00:33:24,278 --> 00:33:27,509
- You're sending him back to jail?.
- I'm not sending him anywhere.

450
00:33:27,614 --> 00:33:30,913
I'm just givin' him
somethin' to think about.

451
00:33:31,018 --> 00:33:33,145
I don't think we have time for him
to just sit around and think about it.

452
00:33:33,253 --> 00:33:37,246
- Oh, really?.
- No, Goodspeed's right. You, go talk to him.

453
00:33:37,357 --> 00:33:40,087
- Me?. Sir, I'm not qualified for that.
- Yes.

454
00:33:40,194 --> 00:33:43,425
- You're an FBI agent.
- What is your specialty again?.

455
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:46,226
- Chemical weapons.
- Don't mention that!

456
00:33:50,037 --> 00:33:52,528
- You want me to lie?.
- Yeah, lie.

457
00:33:54,041 --> 00:33:57,101
We got less than 24 hours.
Give it a shot.

458
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:00,812
Okay.

459
00:34:05,953 --> 00:34:07,181
Hiya!

460
00:34:07,287 --> 00:34:10,051
I'm an agent with the, uh,

461
00:34:10,157 --> 00:34:12,785
eh, Federal- FBI.

462
00:34:12,893 --> 00:34:17,353
Uh- Eh, well, my-
I'm Stanley Goodspeed.

463
00:34:17,464 --> 00:34:20,865
- But of course you are.
- At least he got his name right.

464
00:34:20,968 --> 00:34:25,496
- Of course I am.
- And you have an emergency.

465
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:28,973
That's right.

466
00:34:29,076 --> 00:34:33,376
- And you need my help.
- Exactly right.

467
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,380
Coffee.

468
00:34:35,482 --> 00:34:37,882
No, no, I'm fine,
thank you.

469
00:34:37,985 --> 00:34:40,215
Offer me coffee.

470
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,653
Oh, yes. Well, that was, in fact,
going to be my next-

471
00:34:43,757 --> 00:34:46,555
Could we get a cup of coffee
in here, please?.

472
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:49,527
And offer...
to take these off.

473
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,894
Mr. Mason, really.

474
00:34:51,999 --> 00:34:55,196
- All kidding aside-
- As a gesture of your good faith.

475
00:34:58,372 --> 00:35:02,240
- Prisoner requests to have his handcuff. s taken off..
- No, no, no!

476
00:35:02,342 --> 00:35:06,745
Look, why don't you go ahead and have
his handcuffs taken off, please?.

477
00:35:06,847 --> 00:35:09,407
Well, I guess that's
one way to go.

478
00:35:12,052 --> 00:35:15,749
This is a pardon and release contract
from the Attorney General's office.

479
00:35:15,856 --> 00:35:20,350
Now, it makes you a free man...
provided you cooperate.

480
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:24,794
So, if you'll just, ah, sign,
uh, eh, where it says-

481
00:35:24,898 --> 00:35:28,129
- "Signature"?.
- That's- Yes. "Signature. "

482
00:35:28,235 --> 00:35:33,696
Well... timeo Danaos
et dona ferentis.

483
00:35:33,807 --> 00:35:37,072
" I fear the Greeks
even when they bring gifts. "

484
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:39,645
Oh, an educated man.

485
00:35:39,746 --> 00:35:43,614
That rules out the possibility
of you being a field agent.

486
00:35:44,985 --> 00:35:47,977
In point of fact,
I am a field agent, Mr. Mason.

487
00:35:48,088 --> 00:35:50,215
- Really.
- Yes.

488
00:35:50,324 --> 00:35:53,953
- In which field?.
- Antiterrorism.

489
00:35:54,061 --> 00:35:58,122
Then you're trained in weaponry,
explosives and mortal combat.

490
00:35:58,232 --> 00:36:00,166
Well-trained.

491
00:36:01,568 --> 00:36:03,502
Then it's the Fairmont Hotel.

492
00:36:06,006 --> 00:36:07,906
Okay.

493
00:36:08,008 --> 00:36:12,240
I want a suite...
a shower, a shave...

494
00:36:12,346 --> 00:36:14,678
and the feel of a suit.

495
00:36:14,781 --> 00:36:17,978
May I also suggest a...
a haircut.

496
00:36:18,085 --> 00:36:21,646
- Am I out of style?. - Unless you're
a 20-year-old guitarist from Seattle.

497
00:36:21,755 --> 00:36:24,690
- It's a grunge thing.
- Grunge?.

498
00:36:24,791 --> 00:36:27,783
Yeah. Well, uh, uh-
Okay. Thank you very much.

499
00:36:27,895 --> 00:36:31,023
All right. Call the Fairmont.
Close the floor if necessary,

500
00:36:31,131 --> 00:36:34,100
but I want him sealed off
and he gets two hours max.

501
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:53,580
- Great job, Goodspeed.
- Why don't you throw in a trip to Tahiti while you're at it?

502
00:36:53,687 --> 00:36:55,587
I'll deliver this
to the Attorney General.

503
00:36:55,689 --> 00:36:58,783
Ah, no, you'll give it to me, Reynolds.
And take Attorney Reynolds outside.

504
00:36:58,892 --> 00:37:01,520
There's a car waiting for you.
Thank you.

505
00:37:04,498 --> 00:37:07,956
That's a signed Federal document, sir.
Isn't that illegal?.

506
00:37:08,068 --> 00:37:10,559
You're not acquainted
with the full facts, Goodspeed.

507
00:37:10,671 --> 00:37:15,074
With all due respect, sir, I'd like
clarification. I gave that man my word.

508
00:37:15,175 --> 00:37:19,043
Damn it! You're on a need-to-know
basis, and you don't need to know!

509
00:37:20,747 --> 00:37:23,477
It's uh, eh, kind of curious,
but, uh-

510
00:37:23,583 --> 00:37:26,814
Sir Walter Raleigh, Alcamenes,
Solzhenitsyn, they, uh-

511
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,911
Well, they were all
wrongfully imprisoned.

512
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,497
Womack!

513
00:37:38,598 --> 00:37:42,796
Now, why am I not surprised?
You piece of shit!

514
00:37:42,903 --> 00:37:45,394
Hey, peace! Peace!

515
00:37:51,278 --> 00:37:54,679
Hey, we're not home. Leave a message.

516
00:37:54,781 --> 00:37:57,648
Hi, darling, it's, uh, it's me.

517
00:37:57,751 --> 00:38:03,348
Uh, listen, don't come to San Francisco.
I repeat, do not come to San Francisco.

518
00:38:03,457 --> 00:38:06,392
- Stanley, like hell I'm not comin'!
- Carla! Carla!

519
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:11,021
Wait! Carla-

520
00:38:12,933 --> 00:38:17,267
Who's Carla?. And why don't you
want her to come to San Francisco?.

521
00:38:21,008 --> 00:38:25,274
You're on a need-to-know basis,
and you don't need to know.

522
00:38:25,379 --> 00:38:27,472
Watch it, he'll bite you!

523
00:38:36,223 --> 00:38:40,159
Good. Mobile command
is fully operational.

524
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,728
We'll be there
in approximately two hours.

525
00:38:42,829 --> 00:38:44,729
- I'm not armed, sir.
- Right.

526
00:38:44,831 --> 00:38:47,493
- I am unarmed, sir.
- Well, where's your issue?.

527
00:38:47,601 --> 00:38:51,799
I left it in my-
uh, my sock drawer.

528
00:38:51,905 --> 00:38:54,806
A gun?.

529
00:38:54,908 --> 00:38:57,968
For what?.
You're a chemical freak.

530
00:38:58,078 --> 00:39:03,141
No, I'm a chemical super-freak,
actually, but I still need a gun.

531
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:05,309
Give him a goddamn gun.

532
00:39:07,788 --> 00:39:11,519
Have you fired one of those things
since the academy?.

533
00:39:38,351 --> 00:39:40,911
- Fairmont Hotel.
- Heh, uh, room service?.

534
00:39:41,021 --> 00:39:43,012
Uh, this-
this is the penthouse.

535
00:39:43,123 --> 00:39:45,182
Do you have any snacks
and drinks, huh?.

536
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:47,450
Hello-o-o.

537
00:39:47,561 --> 00:39:50,155
- You the barber?.
- No. Stylist.

538
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:53,858
- Barber.
- Just clippers, no scissors.

539
00:39:53,967 --> 00:39:56,435
No scissors?. You've got to be
kidding me, no scissors.

540
00:39:56,536 --> 00:39:58,868
I mean, did they tell Picasso
"no brush"?.

541
00:39:58,972 --> 00:40:00,803
With scissors,
this man could kill you.

542
00:40:00,907 --> 00:40:04,866
I can't cut anyone's balls off
with a trimmer, now can I?.

543
00:40:04,978 --> 00:40:10,473
Why don't we do this outside?.
Get some sun.

544
00:40:10,584 --> 00:40:15,214
Oh! Who did this to you?. This is
just not right. In fact, it's nasty.

545
00:40:15,322 --> 00:40:19,156
- Well, it's a... grunge thing.
- Well, it's some kind of thing.

546
00:40:19,259 --> 00:40:22,353
Do you think we have time for a sea kelp
protein pack and maybe some color?.

547
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:26,330
- No.
- Okay.

548
00:40:26,433 --> 00:40:28,628
Not very nice, is he?.

549
00:40:28,735 --> 00:40:31,898
No, he's not.

550
00:40:47,154 --> 00:40:50,248
Hey, can't let it go to waste.

551
00:40:50,357 --> 00:40:53,520
Don't you ever stop eatin'?.

552
00:40:53,627 --> 00:40:55,720
Not when it's free.

553
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:59,162
- We're supposed to be on duty.
- Hey, don't worry. He's an old man.

554
00:40:59,266 --> 00:41:02,258
The boss is watchin' him.
Come on, Try some of this lobster.

555
00:41:02,369 --> 00:41:06,032
- Mm-hmm.
- My secretary here will settle the bill.

556
00:41:06,139 --> 00:41:09,802
So, what do you have in store for me,
Womack, when this is over?.

557
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:12,640
You'll get your life back, Mason.

558
00:41:12,746 --> 00:41:15,840
But you could've given me
my life back years ago.

559
00:41:18,852 --> 00:41:21,821
Why should I trust you now?.

560
00:41:21,922 --> 00:41:23,981
You've got my word.

561
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:26,058
Will you shake on it?.

562
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:39,101
Freeze, mister!

563
00:41:39,206 --> 00:41:41,106
Oh, man!

564
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:44,075
Help!

565
00:41:44,177 --> 00:41:47,442
Drop the gun...
or I drop your boss.

566
00:41:47,547 --> 00:41:51,415
- You will not!
- Aaah! Get!

567
00:41:51,518 --> 00:41:56,046
- He's gettin' very heavy.
- Then pull him up!

568
00:41:56,156 --> 00:41:58,181
Aah! Uuh!

569
00:41:58,291 --> 00:42:00,953
Please don't.

570
00:42:01,061 --> 00:42:02,790
Ohh!

571
00:42:02,896 --> 00:42:05,660
Help! Shit!

572
00:42:05,765 --> 00:42:08,495
Come on, have a scallop. Catch.

573
00:42:08,602 --> 00:42:11,765
Ohh!

574
00:42:13,073 --> 00:42:15,303
Ooh-ooh!

575
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:19,310
- You hoist him in!
- Yaah! Oh!

576
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:21,209
Help! Help! Help!

577
00:42:21,314 --> 00:42:24,147
- Where's Mason?.
- Hang on!

578
00:42:24,251 --> 00:42:26,515
- Mason's gone!
- Gone?.

579
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:29,953
Clear!

580
00:42:30,056 --> 00:42:33,514
Living room's clear!

581
00:42:33,627 --> 00:42:36,892
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

582
00:42:36,997 --> 00:42:39,864
All units, this is Caretender. We have
a signal six. He's in the hotel!

583
00:42:46,306 --> 00:42:50,538
Okay, I don't wanna know nothin'. I never
saw you throw that gentleman offthe balcony.

584
00:42:50,644 --> 00:42:54,842
All I care about is,
are you happywith your haircut?.

585
00:42:54,948 --> 00:42:58,042
Aah! Easy! Aah!

586
00:42:58,151 --> 00:43:02,781
Watch it, you fuckhead!
You're gonna pull my arm out!

587
00:43:02,889 --> 00:43:05,380
Watch out! Aah!

588
00:43:19,205 --> 00:43:21,332
- Uuh!
- Watch it!

589
00:43:26,046 --> 00:43:29,174
- Hey, watch it!
- He's right over there!

590
00:43:34,387 --> 00:43:36,821
Uuh! Ah!

591
00:43:36,923 --> 00:43:38,686
Uuh!

592
00:43:44,964 --> 00:43:47,558
Hey! Uuh! Ooh!

593
00:43:47,734 --> 00:43:50,362
This is my Humvee. I don’t want
any dings, dents or scratches.

594
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:54,907
Or I'll have your ass. Hey!
Hey! Stop! Hey!

595
00:43:58,144 --> 00:44:02,274
I was inside with Jack Powell!

596
00:44:02,382 --> 00:44:05,442
- Hey, call the guard!
- Go!

597
00:44:06,619 --> 00:44:09,247
FBI.

598
00:44:19,966 --> 00:44:22,434
Whoo!

599
00:44:27,974 --> 00:44:31,000
Whoa! Whoa!

600
00:44:31,111 --> 00:44:34,638
Suspect is in a black Humvee
heading west on California.

601
00:44:34,748 --> 00:44:36,841
Speed approximately
70 miles per hour.

602
00:44:43,923 --> 00:44:46,255
Get out of the way!

603
00:44:49,596 --> 00:44:52,087
I want a net put on this
son of a bitch, you hear me?.

604
00:45:25,165 --> 00:45:28,134
This guy's hittin' every fuckin' thing
in sight tryin' to block us!

605
00:46:02,001 --> 00:46:04,401
Aah!

606
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:09,138
I hope you're insured!

607
00:46:17,617 --> 00:46:20,711
Oh, well, why not?.

608
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:38,136
You're goin' down!

609
00:46:58,658 --> 00:47:01,183
Hello?.

610
00:47:01,294 --> 00:47:03,489
Sie haben meine Hummer gestolen!

611
00:47:03,596 --> 00:47:06,030
I'm only borrowing your Humvee!

612
00:47:09,736 --> 00:47:11,761
Information?.

613
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,771
San Francisco.

614
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:16,967
Uh, Jade Angelou.
That's A-N-G-

615
00:47:19,112 --> 00:47:21,512
Welcome aboard, y'all.
How y'all doin' today?.

616
00:47:24,551 --> 00:47:25,848
Hang on!

617
00:47:28,855 --> 00:47:31,949
Holy shit!

618
00:47:42,435 --> 00:47:44,665
Whoa-oa!

619
00:47:46,272 --> 00:47:49,241
Oh, no!

620
00:47:53,179 --> 00:47:55,443
We're gonna crash!
Save yourselves!

621
00:48:01,054 --> 00:48:03,113
Oh, my baby!

622
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,793
Oh, no!

623
00:48:22,308 --> 00:48:25,243
Oh, no.

624
00:48:28,281 --> 00:48:31,079
Oh! Oh, God.

625
00:48:32,018 --> 00:48:34,486
Oh, God!

626
00:48:52,705 --> 00:48:56,266
Hey, man.
You just fucked up your Ferrari.

627
00:48:56,376 --> 00:48:59,539
- Oh, no! Baby's goin' down in flames!
- It's not mine.

628
00:48:59,646 --> 00:49:02,012
Neither is this.

629
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:09,520
Damn! This sucks!
Where's that son of a bitch at?.

630
00:49:09,622 --> 00:49:13,388
I'm gonna hunt him down!
That motherfucker ain't safe nowhere!

631
00:49:13,493 --> 00:49:16,018
Chem Weapons, Isherwood.

632
00:49:16,129 --> 00:49:19,587
Marvin, look up
Wolfburg Federal Penitentiary.

633
00:49:19,699 --> 00:49:21,690
The inmate is Mason, John.

634
00:49:21,801 --> 00:49:24,668
Hey, Stan, listen. I'm gettin'
out of this government shithole.

635
00:49:24,771 --> 00:49:27,740
I'm goin' over to Orkin
to design Roach Motels. Cool, huh?.

636
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,740
Look, I just stole
a kid's motorcycle.

637
00:49:29,842 --> 00:49:31,935
I'm not really feeling too good.
Wolfburg, got it?.

638
00:49:32,045 --> 00:49:36,482
Yeah, I got it. All right,
Magrane, Masconi, Masters. No Mason.

639
00:49:36,582 --> 00:49:41,383
Go to February '76. Who was transferred
to Wolfburg from San Quentin?.

640
00:49:41,654 --> 00:49:43,588
This is weird.

641
00:49:43,656 --> 00:49:47,524
They got medical records,
they got place of birth- Glasgow-

642
00:49:47,627 --> 00:49:49,652
Uh, but they don't have a name.

643
00:49:49,762 --> 00:49:51,821
Uh, wait a minute, wait a minute!

644
00:49:51,931 --> 00:49:56,561
They have next of kin, a Jade Angelou
of32 Stenson Drive, San Francisco.

645
00:50:16,723 --> 00:50:18,657
Jade?

646
00:50:18,758 --> 00:50:22,819
No, I'm Stacy, Jade's Friend.

647
00:50:26,933 --> 00:50:29,401
Were you afraid to come alone?.

648
00:50:29,502 --> 00:50:31,766
Yeah.

649
00:50:31,871 --> 00:50:34,101
It's okay.

650
00:50:34,207 --> 00:50:36,732
I'll be over here
if you need me.

651
00:50:36,843 --> 00:50:41,371
- Last photograph I had of you... you were about ten.
- Yeah?.

652
00:50:43,015 --> 00:50:47,952
Well, I found a picture of you
among my mom's things... when she died.

653
00:50:48,054 --> 00:50:50,955
Oh, yeah?. Well, uh-

654
00:50:52,725 --> 00:50:57,321
- Why don't we take a walk?.
- I got him. Palace of Fine Arts.

655
00:50:57,430 --> 00:51:01,389
Your mother, uh-
Ya know, well, sh-she was very special.

656
00:51:01,501 --> 00:51:03,935
Yeah, she was.

657
00:51:04,036 --> 00:51:07,767
But I don't think we should romanticize
what happened between you and her.

658
00:51:07,874 --> 00:51:10,536
Meeting in a bar
after a Led Zeppelin concert.

659
00:51:10,643 --> 00:51:13,942
Head out,
and I was the result.

660
00:51:14,046 --> 00:51:17,504
Well, I’d like to think
it would've led somewhere, if only-

661
00:51:17,617 --> 00:51:19,517
If only what?.
Six federal marshals...

662
00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:22,713
hadn't kicked down our door
and dragged you back to prison?.

663
00:51:22,822 --> 00:51:24,915
I'm sorry.

664
00:51:25,024 --> 00:51:28,187
It's all right.

665
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:31,286
- So they let you out?.
- Yeah.

666
00:51:32,398 --> 00:51:35,299
That's good.

667
00:51:35,401 --> 00:51:38,370
What did you do?.

668
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:47,644
jade, I don't have
a great deal of time here.

669
00:51:49,615 --> 00:51:54,279
But I'll be coming back,
and, uh, maybe we can-

670
00:51:54,387 --> 00:51:56,048
What?. We can what?.

671
00:51:57,623 --> 00:52:03,425
You know... you're almost
the only evidence that I exist.

672
00:52:03,529 --> 00:52:06,020
But I don't know you.

673
00:52:06,132 --> 00:52:08,760
That's what I want to change, eh?.

674
00:52:12,905 --> 00:52:17,501
I've rehearsed this speech a thousand
times on the chance that we would meet.

675
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:20,204
Here we are... and I'm lost.

676
00:52:20,313 --> 00:52:23,749
Well, I don't know how I'm
supposed to be feeling either.

677
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:27,411
jade, I'm not an evil man.

678
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:31,081
If you can believe that,
then it's a start.

679
00:52:34,961 --> 00:52:36,724
Okay.

680
00:52:47,707 --> 00:52:49,937
Is this about you?

681
00:53:01,888 --> 00:53:05,984
You broke out of prison again,
didn't you?.

682
00:53:06,092 --> 00:53:08,652
- Why did you come to me?.
- FBI, ma'am.

683
00:53:08,761 --> 00:53:13,255
Your father's working with us. He's
helping us resolve a dangerous situation.

684
00:53:13,366 --> 00:53:15,493
- He is?.
- Yes, ma'am.

685
00:53:15,601 --> 00:53:18,934
Well, gee whiz, John,
I guess we oughta get goin', huh?.

686
00:53:19,038 --> 00:53:22,303
Whatever you say, Stanley.

687
00:53:27,647 --> 00:53:29,945
Thank you for that.
You could've handled it differently.

688
00:53:30,049 --> 00:53:33,382
What do you say we cut
the chitchat, a-hole?.

689
00:53:33,486 --> 00:53:37,513
You almost got me killed twice,
and my jaw hurts like hell.

690
00:53:37,623 --> 00:53:40,421
- Good.
- Cocksucker!

691
00:53:40,526 --> 00:53:43,962
If I had my way, you would be shipped
back to Wolfburg in leg irons...

692
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:46,497
and caged like an animal for the rest
of your natural fuckin' life!

693
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:48,499
You wrecked half the city!

694
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:55,798
- Give me a hand with the system.
- Now, tell me about the tunnels.

695
00:53:55,908 --> 00:53:59,639
If you know the system, it will take you
wherever you need to go.

696
00:53:59,745 --> 00:54:05,308
There's an intake pipe here, below
low tide. Is that our best access?.

697
00:54:05,418 --> 00:54:08,751
- Yes, that's exactly where I came out.
- Then beneath the cistern...

698
00:54:08,854 --> 00:54:11,288
there's a connection
to the abandoned septic system.

699
00:54:11,390 --> 00:54:16,259
- How many feet is that?.
- Ehh... 57 paces.

700
00:54:16,362 --> 00:54:18,489
Where do we go from there?

701
00:54:21,233 --> 00:54:23,997
Where do you go from there?.

702
00:54:24,103 --> 00:54:26,537
That's a good question.

703
00:54:28,441 --> 00:54:31,933
- I have no idea.
- What?.

704
00:54:32,044 --> 00:54:35,343
I mean... I'll know
when we're all inside.

705
00:54:35,448 --> 00:54:39,009
No. You're not goddamn goin'.
Show us on the blueprints.

706
00:54:39,118 --> 00:54:42,519
I can't!
My blueprint was in my head.

707
00:54:42,621 --> 00:54:46,057
I was underground
for three days in the dark,

708
00:54:46,158 --> 00:54:49,355
just waiting
for the tides to be right.

709
00:54:49,462 --> 00:54:51,623
But don't worry.
It'll all come back to me.

710
00:54:51,731 --> 00:54:54,859
You're not going anywhere, Mason.

711
00:54:54,967 --> 00:54:56,457
Wait a second.

712
00:54:56,569 --> 00:55:00,972
This piece of work might be the only
chance those people over there have.

713
00:55:01,073 --> 00:55:03,837
If he’s not going, then why the hell
did we get him out of jail?.

714
00:55:03,943 --> 00:55:07,140
- He's smart.
- I got him out to get you people in, not go with you.

715
00:55:07,246 --> 00:55:11,205
If it’s the only way of getting
the intelligence I need, then he goes.

716
00:55:11,317 --> 00:55:13,251
He'll fuck with you.

717
00:55:13,352 --> 00:55:17,118
You compromise my men's lives,
and I'll bury you out there.

718
00:55:18,991 --> 00:55:23,951
Now, Womack... you're between
the Rock and a hard case.

719
00:55:25,264 --> 00:55:28,097
Hmm.
How's your bowling arm?.

720
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:33,231
Dr. Goodspeed, the goal
is to take out the launchers...

721
00:55:33,339 --> 00:55:35,500
then neutralize
the V.X. chemical rounds.

722
00:55:35,608 --> 00:55:38,202
Well, we know the poison's
being kept in the prison morgue...

723
00:55:38,310 --> 00:55:41,768
from the satellite thermal imagining,
which is right here- these dots.

724
00:55:41,881 --> 00:55:43,974
Have you ever actually seen
one of these devices?.

725
00:55:44,083 --> 00:55:46,074
No, sir,
but I've studied them.

726
00:55:46,185 --> 00:55:49,677
I should really begin briefing your guys
on defusing and detoxification.

727
00:55:49,789 --> 00:55:52,690
Got a really neat layout here
of the chem round as well as the rocket.

728
00:55:52,792 --> 00:55:55,352
- So let's get rolling.
- That won't be necessary.

729
00:55:57,229 --> 00:55:59,891
Oh, it's very necessary, sir.

730
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:02,866
The power of this chemical
is way beyond anything you can imagine.

731
00:56:02,968 --> 00:56:05,664
An ecological disaster, sir.

732
00:56:05,771 --> 00:56:08,171
Plus, the devices themselves
are complicated.

733
00:56:08,274 --> 00:56:11,107
That's why you're coming with us.

734
00:56:13,245 --> 00:56:14,473
I am?.

735
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:17,811
You're the expert.
What's your problem?.

736
00:56:17,917 --> 00:56:22,149
You mean I'm going-
going out there... under the water?.

737
00:56:22,254 --> 00:56:27,214
Well, earlier today you wanted a gun.
Now you're getting a gun and a wet suit.

738
00:56:27,326 --> 00:56:29,351
Have you ever been
in a combat situation?.

739
00:56:29,462 --> 00:56:32,625
- Define "combat," sir.
- Shep?.

740
00:56:32,731 --> 00:56:35,598
An incursion underwater
to retake an impregnable fortress...

741
00:56:35,701 --> 00:56:38,431
held by an elite team of U.S. Marines
in possession of 81 hostages...

742
00:56:38,537 --> 00:56:42,166
and 15 guided rockets
armed with V.X. poison gas.

743
00:56:42,274 --> 00:56:46,506
Oh. In that case, no, sir.
Excuse me.

744
00:56:52,985 --> 00:56:55,476
- Here.
- Ah, thank you.

745
00:56:57,756 --> 00:57:00,156
You don't look too good.

746
00:57:00,259 --> 00:57:02,887
In fact, you look like shit.

747
00:57:02,995 --> 00:57:07,159
My stomach's doing hula hoops
around my ass.

748
00:57:07,266 --> 00:57:11,032
You all right?. I mean,
you gonna make it through this thing?.

749
00:57:11,137 --> 00:57:13,435
I don't know.

750
00:57:13,539 --> 00:57:16,565
I always expected something
like this was going to happen,

751
00:57:16,675 --> 00:57:18,734
but nothing prepares you for it.

752
00:57:18,844 --> 00:57:22,075
Now I'm-
I'm responsible...

753
00:57:22,181 --> 00:57:24,877
for a whole city.

754
00:57:24,984 --> 00:57:28,886
Look, I know this isn't easy for you.

755
00:57:28,988 --> 00:57:31,354
Remember, you were trained
for this kind of situation...

756
00:57:31,457 --> 00:57:33,357
and believe me,
it'll come back to you.

757
00:57:33,459 --> 00:57:36,121
Besides, you got the best SEAL team
in the country backin' you up.

758
00:57:36,228 --> 00:57:39,629
Okay.
You're right.

759
00:57:40,966 --> 00:57:44,026
I'll be on the wire.
I'll help talk you through it.

760
00:57:44,136 --> 00:57:48,539
There's something else.
It's terrible.

761
00:57:48,641 --> 00:57:52,600
N- No, it's wonderful...
except it isn't.

762
00:57:52,711 --> 00:57:56,442
My girlfriend's pregnant...

763
00:57:56,549 --> 00:58:00,781
and she's...
just flown in to see me.

764
00:58:00,886 --> 00:58:03,616
You keep your mind on what you're
going to be doing out there tonight,

765
00:58:03,722 --> 00:58:07,556
and I'll send someone to pick up your girlfriend and bring
her here to the command center.

766
00:58:19,438 --> 00:58:23,306
- Hummel!
- Hello, Frank. Lou Linstrom.

767
00:58:23,409 --> 00:58:27,175
I'm at the White House
with General Kramer.

768
00:58:27,279 --> 00:58:31,113
Uh, Frank, uh, we're havin' a few
problems with the account transfer.

769
00:58:31,217 --> 00:58:33,515
Don't tell me problems,
tell me solutions.

770
00:58:33,619 --> 00:58:37,953
We've spoken to the President, and I know
that you're aware of his stance on terrorism.

771
00:58:38,057 --> 00:58:42,289
- So what we'd like to do- - This isn't
about terrorism. This is about justice.

772
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:45,261
It's about reminding people who found it
politically convenient to forget.

773
00:58:45,364 --> 00:58:49,323
- This is goin' nowhere, Frank.
- Well, let me tell you what is:

774
00:58:49,435 --> 00:58:52,199
15 V.X. gas rockets into
the heart of San Francisco.

775
00:58:52,304 --> 00:58:54,499
You've got 17 hours
to deliver the money.

776
00:58:54,607 --> 00:58:57,303
Or be prepared to reap
the whirlwind, gentlemen.

777
00:59:01,347 --> 00:59:03,577
What's the word from Mojave?.

778
00:59:03,682 --> 00:59:08,415
General Peterson can give us no definite
assurance on the thermite plasma.

779
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,579
That is the word.

780
00:59:15,227 --> 00:59:17,195
Green light to SEAL incursion.

781
00:59:35,281 --> 00:59:37,249
Fall in!

782
00:59:37,349 --> 00:59:41,012
All right. Listen up.
Mr. Mason will run point for us.

783
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,213
Lieutenant Shepard will be
attached to his hip.

784
00:59:43,322 --> 00:59:47,918
You breathe, he breathes with you.
You piss, he helps. Understood?

785
00:59:49,495 --> 00:59:52,623
Dr. Goodspeed is our specialist.
When he neutralizes the threat,

786
00:59:52,731 --> 00:59:56,531
we launch green flares
and we wait for the cavalry.

787
00:59:56,635 --> 01:00:00,435
Make no mistake, gentlemen,
we're in the fight of our lives,

788
01:00:00,539 --> 01:00:02,700
against maybe the greatest
battalion commander...

789
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:04,799
in the Vietnam War,
I shit you not.

790
01:00:06,145 --> 01:00:08,841
Any questions?

791
01:00:08,947 --> 01:00:10,710
Let's load up!

792
01:00:19,825 --> 01:00:22,293
After you, ace.

793
01:00:43,515 --> 01:00:47,451
Pass out and activate
the Minicams.

794
01:00:47,553 --> 01:00:49,953
Everything set here?.

795
01:00:50,055 --> 01:00:52,649
Minicams operational?.

796
01:00:52,758 --> 01:00:55,955
Roger that, sir.
We are on line.

797
01:00:59,865 --> 01:01:03,824
Shep, what's the status on the special
operational gear for Mr. Mason?.

798
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:08,973
Let's see, we have, uh,

799
01:01:09,074 --> 01:01:13,010
one quart of kerosene
and a squeeze bottle,

800
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:20,880
three washers
and waterproof matches.

801
01:01:20,986 --> 01:01:24,319
Use the green flares to signal
when the threat has been neutralized.

802
01:01:24,423 --> 01:01:27,551
Now, this is atropine.
If you come in contact with the gas,

803
01:01:27,659 --> 01:01:29,991
you have 20 seconds
to inject it into your heart.

804
01:01:30,095 --> 01:01:32,495
Don't fuck with me on this.
It may save your life.

805
01:01:36,101 --> 01:01:41,664
I have three incoming bogeys
bearing 2-7-5. Range: 6,000 meters.

806
01:01:45,077 --> 01:01:47,477
FBI Command Center?.

807
01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:50,810
Oh, I would just love for you
to tell me what is goin' on.

808
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:53,214
- Nope.
- Stanley Goodspeed is my boyfriend.

809
01:01:53,318 --> 01:01:57,152
- Actually, he's my fiancé. Where is he?.
- Classified, lady.

810
01:01:57,256 --> 01:02:00,225
Okay, well you just sit here
and act like a Bureau bonehead, then.

811
01:02:00,325 --> 01:02:02,486
Hey, where are you-
Goddamn it.

812
01:02:07,533 --> 01:02:10,093
Decoy choppers commencing
run to Alcatraz.

813
01:02:11,870 --> 01:02:14,031
I just lost one, sir.
I just lost one.

814
01:02:14,139 --> 01:02:16,801
We only got two flying in.
I just lost one.

815
01:02:16,909 --> 01:02:18,103
Shit.

816
01:02:27,553 --> 01:02:31,353
In my day, we did it all
with a snorkel and a pair of flippers.

817
01:02:31,457 --> 01:02:34,551
- Your day?.
- Yes, didn't you read my resume?.

818
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:37,527
I don't- I don't know
anything about you.

819
01:02:37,629 --> 01:02:40,462
- I know something about you, Godspell.
- Goodspeed.

820
01:02:40,566 --> 01:02:43,592
Goodspeed,
Godspeed, Godspell,

821
01:02:43,702 --> 01:02:47,035
you never went
to any anti-terrorist school.

822
01:02:47,139 --> 01:02:50,040
So just make sure you don't
get us all fucking killed.

823
01:02:52,878 --> 01:02:56,109
- We're going dark.
- Night vision!

824
01:02:57,749 --> 01:03:00,240
Raider One has dropped
below radar coverage,

825
01:03:00,352 --> 01:03:03,549
heading around Treasure Island.

826
01:03:03,655 --> 01:03:07,022
Sir, we've got two bogeys
bearing due east and closing.

827
01:03:11,997 --> 01:03:13,988
Decoys?.

828
01:03:14,099 --> 01:03:17,068
- Prepare to deploy!
- Good luck, Commander.

829
01:03:22,174 --> 01:03:24,108
Sir, Raider One
is at the drop zone.

830
01:03:26,411 --> 01:03:29,608
Stanley's not a very good swimmer.
I mean, he can't even snorkel.

831
01:03:30,782 --> 01:03:33,182
- Everyone, good to go?
- Good to go!

832
01:03:33,285 --> 01:03:37,016
- Good to go!
- Good to go!

833
01:03:45,697 --> 01:03:49,258
So the S.D.U.s have been deployed,
and the Eagles are in the water.

834
01:03:59,044 --> 01:04:02,411
Major, I want the perimeter
patrolled to the west end of the island.

835
01:04:02,514 --> 01:04:04,539
Yes, sir.
Hendrix, you lead the patrol.

836
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:08,108
- Aye, sir.
- Let's move! Move out, move out!

837
01:05:04,876 --> 01:05:08,334
The Eagles are on the Rock.
They've entered the cistern room.

838
01:05:13,518 --> 01:05:19,286
Thank you very fucking much, Mr. Mason.
You sent us into a room with no exit.

839
01:05:22,494 --> 01:05:24,462
Any ideas, Dillinger?.

840
01:05:24,563 --> 01:05:27,191
Figure it out soon.
We're sitting ducks.

841
01:05:27,299 --> 01:05:31,235
- Real tight on time.
- You stand by the door. Until I open it.

842
01:05:31,336 --> 01:05:34,533
I'd like to know how you plan
on accomplishing that.

843
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,437
Through here.

844
01:05:43,015 --> 01:05:44,915
You're shitting me.

845
01:05:45,017 --> 01:05:48,817
I memorized the timing.
I just hope it hasn't been changed.

846
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:52,583
You catch one of those
flame bursts, you're a corpse.

847
01:05:52,691 --> 01:05:55,922
- Thank you. - Commander, you said
never leave his side, but, uh-

848
01:05:56,028 --> 01:06:01,022
- Stand fast, Lieutenant.
- Have a nice day.

849
01:06:23,388 --> 01:06:27,188
- Where'd you dig up this guy?.
- That's classified.

850
01:06:34,366 --> 01:06:37,529
Clear here, sir.
No motion sensors tripped.

851
01:06:37,636 --> 01:06:41,265
- Nothing.
- Well, tell them to stay out there.

852
01:06:41,373 --> 01:06:43,637
Sweep forward!

853
01:06:52,417 --> 01:06:54,510
Looks like he fucked us,
Commander.

854
01:06:54,619 --> 01:06:58,453
I knew it.
That son of a bitch jumped ship.

855
01:07:03,695 --> 01:07:05,822
Welcome to the Rock.

856
01:07:20,846 --> 01:07:24,782
- Mason.
- That's a no-no. That's the subway.

857
01:07:24,883 --> 01:07:28,375
- That'll drop you into the tunnels.
- Do it!

858
01:07:46,004 --> 01:07:49,496
Sir, the Eagles
have breached the tunnel system.

859
01:07:55,814 --> 01:07:58,305
You enjoying this?.

860
01:07:58,416 --> 01:08:01,476
Well, it's certainly
more enjoyable than my average day:

861
01:08:01,586 --> 01:08:05,647
reading philosophy,
avoiding gang rape in the washroom.

862
01:08:05,757 --> 01:08:10,126
Though it's less of a problem these
days. Maybe I'm losing my sex appeal.

863
01:08:14,666 --> 01:08:17,897
We've got seismic activity
in one of the storm grates. North side.

864
01:08:18,003 --> 01:08:20,767
Continue patrolling the area.

865
01:08:20,872 --> 01:08:24,035
Sweep forward.

866
01:08:24,142 --> 01:08:27,407
Commander, halt.
We've got movement.

867
01:08:27,512 --> 01:08:29,980
They're hearing sounds above, sir.

868
01:08:30,081 --> 01:08:33,881
Stand fast.
Down, down, down.

869
01:08:39,157 --> 01:08:41,751
West storm drain's clear.

870
01:08:46,164 --> 01:08:49,827
Ninety-seven paces
to the shower room.

871
01:08:54,105 --> 01:08:57,302
The Eagles are now at the access tunnel.
They're right under the shower room.

872
01:09:04,449 --> 01:09:06,076
Fiber optics.

873
01:09:09,955 --> 01:09:13,516
- Something's not right.
- I've got a bad feeling about this.

874
01:09:32,230 --> 01:09:34,323
Quiet.

875
01:09:44,709 --> 01:09:47,542
Motion sensors.

876
01:09:47,645 --> 01:09:51,877
- Beams cutting across manhole covers.
- Deal with it.

877
01:09:56,221 --> 01:10:00,157
Commander, the beam is hitting
some sort of reflective device.

878
01:10:00,258 --> 01:10:02,055
Possibly a prism.

879
01:10:04,295 --> 01:10:07,628
I want to use a mirror
to cut the beam,

880
01:10:07,732 --> 01:10:10,860
send the beam
back to its source...

881
01:10:10,969 --> 01:10:12,994
and then I'm
going to move the prism.

882
01:10:17,442 --> 01:10:19,910
We've got motion on a trembler
in the shower room, sir.

883
01:10:20,011 --> 01:10:22,172
We've got visitors.
Let's move.

884
01:10:25,150 --> 01:10:28,119
Got it. Good to go.

885
01:10:33,158 --> 01:10:35,353
Stand fast.
We'll secure the area.

886
01:10:46,304 --> 01:10:49,762
They're entering
to the shower room, sir.

887
01:10:52,310 --> 01:10:54,904
They're securing the area.

888
01:11:03,221 --> 01:11:06,088
just sit tight.

889
01:11:07,792 --> 01:11:11,694
Drop your weapons!
Drop 'em!

890
01:11:11,796 --> 01:11:13,957
- Get back!
- Hold your fire.

891
01:11:14,065 --> 01:11:16,124
Drop your weapons.
Hold your fire!

892
01:11:19,070 --> 01:11:20,731
It's a fucking trap.

893
01:11:22,807 --> 01:11:26,436
This is Gen. Hummel.
Drop your weapons.

894
01:11:26,544 --> 01:11:28,273
Drop 'em!

895
01:11:28,379 --> 01:11:34,045
Anderson here, Gen. Hummel.
Commander. Team leader.

896
01:11:34,152 --> 01:11:37,121
Cmdr. Anderson, if you have any concern
for the lives of your men...

897
01:11:37,222 --> 01:11:40,248
you will order them to safety their
weapons and place them on the deck.

898
01:11:40,358 --> 01:11:41,723
This is not happening.

899
01:11:41,826 --> 01:11:47,264
Sir, we know why you're out here.
God knows I agree with you.

900
01:11:47,365 --> 01:11:51,563
But like you, I swore to defend
this country against all enemies...

901
01:11:51,669 --> 01:11:55,765
foreign, sir, and domestic.

902
01:11:55,874 --> 01:12:00,311
General, we've spilled
the same blood in the same mud.

903
01:12:00,411 --> 01:12:03,312
You know goddamn well
I can't give that order.

904
01:12:03,414 --> 01:12:04,972
We're dead.

905
01:12:05,083 --> 01:12:08,484
Your unit is covered from
an elevated position, Commander.

906
01:12:08,586 --> 01:12:12,317
I'm not gonna ask again.
Don't do anything stupid.

907
01:12:12,423 --> 01:12:14,857
No one has to die here.

908
01:12:14,959 --> 01:12:19,293
Men following the general, you're
under oath as United States Marines!

909
01:12:19,397 --> 01:12:21,297
Have you forgotten that?.

910
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:24,727
We all have shipmates
we remember.

911
01:12:24,836 --> 01:12:28,169
Some of them were shit on
and pissed on by the Pentagon.

912
01:12:28,273 --> 01:12:31,470
But that doesn't give you
the right to mutiny!

913
01:12:31,576 --> 01:12:34,306
You cal I it what you want!
You're down there; we're up here.

914
01:12:34,412 --> 01:12:36,312
You walked into the wrong
goddamn room!

915
01:12:36,414 --> 01:12:38,507
- Stand fast!
- Commander, one last time.

916
01:12:38,616 --> 01:12:40,550
You tell your men
to safety their weapons.

917
01:12:40,652 --> 01:12:43,382
- I cannot give that order!
- I am not gonna repeat that order!

918
01:12:43,488 --> 01:12:46,355
- I will not give that order!
- What the hell is wrong with you, man?.

919
01:12:46,457 --> 01:12:48,982
- Stand fast!
- Oh, my God!

920
01:12:49,093 --> 01:12:51,027
- Let's waste these fuckers.
- One last time.

921
01:12:51,129 --> 01:12:55,691
Order your men to safety their weapons.

922
01:13:00,405 --> 01:13:02,305
Cease fire!

923
01:13:21,459 --> 01:13:23,984
Don't go.

924
01:13:25,964 --> 01:13:27,864
Cease fire!

925
01:13:36,808 --> 01:13:38,673
Cease fire!

926
01:13:38,776 --> 01:13:43,042
Shit. Goddamn it.
Let go of me. Let go of me!

927
01:13:43,147 --> 01:13:45,581
Don't, don't go.

928
01:14:23,187 --> 01:14:24,415
Fuck.

929
01:14:34,899 --> 01:14:36,799
It's over.

930
01:14:46,511 --> 01:14:48,945
Oh, God!

931
01:15:19,243 --> 01:15:21,074
We got some movement.

932
01:15:21,179 --> 01:15:24,273
- Who?. Who is it?.
- Two of 'em. Eagles 11 and 12.

933
01:15:24,382 --> 01:15:27,112
- It's Goodspeed and Mason.
- I knew it.

934
01:15:27,218 --> 01:15:30,278
I've gotta get a team together.
We've gotta move with the second option.

935
01:15:30,388 --> 01:15:32,481
What, and invite another
massacre?. No way.

936
01:15:32,590 --> 01:15:36,617
We've got a 60-year-old convict and
a lab rat. I'm telling you, it's over.

937
01:15:36,728 --> 01:15:39,322
Not for Mason, it isn't.

938
01:15:50,808 --> 01:15:54,869
Goodspeed,
I'm not gonna kill you.

939
01:15:57,548 --> 01:16:00,210
- Where are you going?.
- Off this bloody island.

940
01:16:00,318 --> 01:16:02,309
What?. Wh- What for?.

941
01:16:02,420 --> 01:16:06,015
Goodspeed, do you read me?.

942
01:16:06,124 --> 01:16:08,524
It's for you.

943
01:16:10,027 --> 01:16:12,495
- Sir?.
- What's the status?.

944
01:16:12,597 --> 01:16:15,157
The status is, they're dead.
They're dead!

945
01:16:15,266 --> 01:16:17,496
It's just me and Mason.
Now he says he's leaving.

946
01:16:17,602 --> 01:16:21,003
That is unacceptable,
do you hear me?. Unacceptable!

947
01:16:21,105 --> 01:16:24,404
Well, there's a problem, sir.
He's got a gun.

948
01:16:24,509 --> 01:16:26,443
What do you have,
a fuckin' water pistol?.

949
01:16:26,544 --> 01:16:30,412
- No, sir.
- Go after him and stop him.

950
01:16:32,517 --> 01:16:34,747
I didn't want this.

951
01:16:34,852 --> 01:16:37,514
- Jesus, I didn't want this.
- We knew this might happen.

952
01:16:37,622 --> 01:16:40,716
- Well, maybe now they'll pay up.
- Maybe now they won’t, Captain.

953
01:16:40,825 --> 01:16:43,350
Then maybe we need to execute
a few hostages.

954
01:16:43,461 --> 01:16:46,157
- Got a live one!
- Put a bullet in him.

955
01:16:46,264 --> 01:16:48,232
You heard him, end it.

956
01:16:48,332 --> 01:16:50,357
Holster that sidearm, Captain!

957
01:17:08,786 --> 01:17:10,811
Sir?.

958
01:17:14,158 --> 01:17:19,061
You made a terrible mistake. And more
of our brothers have died in vain.

959
01:17:19,163 --> 01:17:23,156
Damn you for forcing me
into this position.

960
01:17:26,304 --> 01:17:29,239
I need to talk to you.
Right now, alone.

961
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:31,638
Now, you told me
I'm on a need-to-know basis,

962
01:17:31,742 --> 01:17:33,937
and I'm tellin' you right now
I need to know...

963
01:17:34,045 --> 01:17:37,310
who the fuck John Mason is right now.

964
01:17:37,415 --> 01:17:41,351
All right, you wanna know?.
1962,J. Edgar Hoover...

965
01:17:41,452 --> 01:17:44,182
is head of the FBI,
some say the country.

966
01:17:44,288 --> 01:17:48,224
It's no secret he kept microfilm files
on prominent Americans and Europeans:

967
01:17:48,326 --> 01:17:51,818
de Gaulle, British members
of Parliament, even the Prime Minister.

968
01:17:51,929 --> 01:17:55,228
I mean, this guy had dirt
on everybody in the world.

969
01:17:55,333 --> 01:17:58,825
Yeah, I know all the cloak-and-dagger
stories. Where does Mason fit in?.

970
01:17:58,936 --> 01:18:01,666
Mason was the British operative
who stole the files.

971
01:18:01,772 --> 01:18:04,502
But our Bureau agents caught him
at the Canadian border.

972
01:18:04,609 --> 01:18:07,806
Of course, the British claimed
they'd never heard of him.

973
01:18:07,912 --> 01:18:12,406
And we held him without trial
until he gave up the microfilm.

974
01:18:12,516 --> 01:18:14,484
But he never did.

975
01:18:14,585 --> 01:18:17,782
I'm surprised Hoover didn't
use his daughter as leverage.

976
01:18:17,889 --> 01:18:20,790
Hoover was dead in '72.
She wasn't born yet.

977
01:18:20,892 --> 01:18:24,350
Today, well,
it's a different bureau.

978
01:18:24,462 --> 01:18:28,728
So you held this guy without trial
his whole life. No wonder he's pissed.

979
01:18:28,833 --> 01:18:33,202
This man knows our most intimate secrets
from the last half-century:

980
01:18:33,304 --> 01:18:38,173
the alien landing at Roswell, the truth
about the J.F.K. assassination.

981
01:18:38,276 --> 01:18:42,178
And Mason's angry, he's lethal.
He's a trained killer.

982
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:47,149
And he is the only hope
that we have got.

983
01:18:47,418 --> 01:18:51,616
Mason! Mason!

984
01:18:51,722 --> 01:18:54,782
There are 81 hostages
still up there.

985
01:18:54,892 --> 01:18:56,689
Yeah. Like me.

986
01:18:56,794 --> 01:18:59,388
You wanna play tough?.
You wanna play tough with me?.

987
01:18:59,497 --> 01:19:02,330
Okay, FBI!
Freeze, sucker!

988
01:19:03,668 --> 01:19:07,764
- I'll fire.
- No, you won't.

989
01:19:07,872 --> 01:19:12,332
- Throw down.
- You're not the sort.

990
01:19:12,443 --> 01:19:14,343
Let's find out.

991
01:19:17,848 --> 01:19:20,510
I could; you, no.

992
01:19:20,618 --> 01:19:23,849
Besides, your safety's on.

993
01:19:23,955 --> 01:19:27,516
Goodspeed, have you
resolved the situation?

994
01:19:27,625 --> 01:19:31,026
Not yet.

995
01:19:31,128 --> 01:19:36,361
- He's got all the guns now, sir.
- Shit!

996
01:19:36,467 --> 01:19:39,561
You're right, I don't use guns,
and I don't kick down doors.

997
01:19:39,670 --> 01:19:41,900
- This is what I do.
- I haven't got my glasses.

998
01:19:42,006 --> 01:19:46,238
What it says is,
"Chemical Weapons Specialist. "

999
01:19:46,344 --> 01:19:47,811
That's right.

1000
01:19:47,912 --> 01:19:51,075
I got a lunatic up there,
man, with 15 missiles...

1001
01:19:51,182 --> 01:19:53,116
armed with some
really funky stuff.

1002
01:19:53,217 --> 01:19:58,780
That lying Womack.
You could've told my daughter.

1003
01:19:58,889 --> 01:20:03,417
It was classified.
Look, I'm in the same situation.

1004
01:20:03,527 --> 01:20:06,724
They've got my girlfriend
in the city with a baby on the way.

1005
01:20:06,831 --> 01:20:10,323
Look, I can defuse the rockets.
I really can.

1006
01:20:10,434 --> 01:20:14,063
But I'm gonna need your help,
and I'm gonna need it right now.

1007
01:20:21,712 --> 01:20:24,476
Sir, this man's weapons
and tack radio are missing!

1008
01:20:24,582 --> 01:20:27,676
Shit, we got a rodent problem.
Flush the pipes.

1009
01:20:27,785 --> 01:20:30,379
There's probably a maze of
tunnels on this goddamn island.

1010
01:20:30,488 --> 01:20:33,116
- Check every access you can find.
- Sir!

1011
01:20:38,896 --> 01:20:41,387
Even if you escape
from the island...

1012
01:20:41,499 --> 01:20:44,366
you can't escape the rockets.

1013
01:20:44,468 --> 01:20:46,800
So, where are you gonna go?.

1014
01:20:46,904 --> 01:20:49,634
Go where?.
What're you gonna do?.

1015
01:20:52,410 --> 01:20:54,640
Show me where
the morgue is, Mason.

1016
01:20:54,745 --> 01:20:56,975
I'm out of here.

1017
01:20:59,083 --> 01:21:02,143
What about your daughter? Mason?

1018
01:21:04,088 --> 01:21:05,555
Rodents located.

1019
01:21:05,656 --> 01:21:09,717
The way I see it, you don't
really have any choice, do you?.

1020
01:21:09,827 --> 01:21:12,057
I don't think you do.

1021
01:21:23,507 --> 01:21:27,307
Move!

1022
01:21:30,347 --> 01:21:31,905
Ooooh!

1023
01:21:51,035 --> 01:21:55,028
- They're on to us.
- Burn 'em out.

1024
01:21:57,208 --> 01:21:59,438
This mother's gonna blow big.

1025
01:22:40,584 --> 01:22:44,611
I don't understand. How could we lose
radio contact all of a sudden?.

1026
01:22:44,722 --> 01:22:47,282
We've lost coms.
Still got 'em on locaters.

1027
01:22:55,199 --> 01:22:58,498
- So what's it gonna be?.
- What?.

1028
01:22:58,602 --> 01:23:02,971
- How do you like your choices?.
- I don't.

1029
01:23:03,073 --> 01:23:06,736
That's what I thought.

1030
01:23:06,844 --> 01:23:08,744
Come on.

1031
01:23:08,846 --> 01:23:11,610
This is the oldest part of Alcatraz.

1032
01:23:11,715 --> 01:23:15,276
Did you know it was originally
a Civil War fort?.

1033
01:23:15,386 --> 01:23:18,378
Oh, really?. Yeah, wow.
You know, I like history, too,

1034
01:23:18,489 --> 01:23:21,617
and maybe when this is over, you and I
can stop by the souvenir shop together,

1035
01:23:21,725 --> 01:23:26,094
but right now, I just- I just-
I wanna find some rockets.

1036
01:23:26,197 --> 01:23:29,257
Don't tempt me.

1037
01:23:29,366 --> 01:23:32,893
We are going to the morgue.

1038
01:23:54,892 --> 01:23:58,225
- You sure you're ready for this?.
- I'll do my best.

1039
01:23:58,329 --> 01:24:00,820
Your best?.

1040
01:24:00,931 --> 01:24:04,367
Losers always whine about their best.

1041
01:24:04,468 --> 01:24:08,404
Winners go home
and fuck the prom queen.

1042
01:24:09,940 --> 01:24:11,840
Carla was the prom queen.

1043
01:24:11,942 --> 01:24:15,537
- Really?.
- Yeah.

1044
01:24:17,214 --> 01:24:20,047
Locaters have them
approaching the morgue, sir.

1045
01:24:20,150 --> 01:24:22,710
Come on, come on,
you can do it, Doc.

1046
01:24:26,690 --> 01:24:30,421
Shit! Aaaaaah!

1047
01:24:30,527 --> 01:24:33,087
You must never hesitate.

1048
01:24:56,120 --> 01:24:58,953
I think you're shooting
too close to the rocket.

1049
01:24:59,056 --> 01:25:01,354
Him, but not the rocket.

1050
01:25:01,458 --> 01:25:04,154
Any other news, professor?

1051
01:25:05,663 --> 01:25:09,190
The rocket!
Not the rocket!

1052
01:25:15,873 --> 01:25:18,034
Aaah! Uhhh!

1053
01:25:23,580 --> 01:25:25,980
I got a little something for ya.

1054
01:25:35,559 --> 01:25:37,993
Yaaaah!

1055
01:25:49,340 --> 01:25:53,401
Uh, yeah, okay, that's just about
the most awful thing I've ever seen.

1056
01:25:55,212 --> 01:26:01,447
Mason... the second you don't
respect this, it kills you.

1057
01:26:01,552 --> 01:26:03,452
Put it over there.

1058
01:26:14,565 --> 01:26:17,432
You've been around a lot of corpses.
Is that normal?.

1059
01:26:17,534 --> 01:26:20,765
- What, the feet thing?
- Yeah, the feet thing.

1060
01:26:20,871 --> 01:26:25,365
- Yeah, that happens.
- Can you do something about it?.

1061
01:26:25,476 --> 01:26:28,138
Like what?.
Kill him again?.

1062
01:26:28,245 --> 01:26:30,645
Listen, I'm just a biochemist.

1063
01:26:30,748 --> 01:26:35,048
Most of the time, I work in a glass jar
and lead a very uneventful life.

1064
01:26:35,152 --> 01:26:38,883
I drive a Volvo, a beige one.
But what I'm dealing with here...

1065
01:26:38,989 --> 01:26:42,618
is one of the most deadly substances
the earth has ever known.

1066
01:26:42,726 --> 01:26:45,126
So what do you say
you cut me some friggin' slack?.

1067
01:27:01,445 --> 01:27:03,413
A really elegant
string-of-pearls configuration.

1068
01:27:03,514 --> 01:27:06,278
Unfortunately,
incredibly unstable.

1069
01:27:06,383 --> 01:27:08,476
What exactly
does this stuff do?.

1070
01:27:08,585 --> 01:27:12,646
If the rocket renders it aerosol, it can
take out the entire city of people.

1071
01:27:12,756 --> 01:27:17,090
Really?. What happens
if you drop one?.

1072
01:27:17,194 --> 01:27:20,163
Happily, it'll just
wipe out you and me.

1073
01:27:20,264 --> 01:27:23,597
- How?.
- It's a cholinesterase inhibitor.

1074
01:27:23,700 --> 01:27:26,999
It stops the brain from sending messages
down the spinal cord within 30 seconds.

1075
01:27:27,104 --> 01:27:30,164
Any epidermal exposure
or inhalation, and you'll know.

1076
01:27:30,274 --> 01:27:34,973
A twinge at the small of your back as
the poison seizes your nervous system.

1077
01:27:35,078 --> 01:27:36,705
Do not move that!

1078
01:27:39,216 --> 01:27:42,276
Your muscles freeze,
you can't breathe...

1079
01:27:42,386 --> 01:27:45,412
you spasm so hard you break
your own back, spit your guts out.

1080
01:27:45,522 --> 01:27:51,017
- But that's after your skin melts off.
- My God.

1081
01:27:51,128 --> 01:27:54,461
Well, I think we’d like God
on our side at the moment, don't you?.

1082
01:27:54,565 --> 01:27:58,899
So what I'm doing now is removing
the guidance system chips...

1083
01:27:59,002 --> 01:28:02,369
so the rocket will splash
down after 500 feet.

1084
01:28:02,473 --> 01:28:05,499
All right, let me have that.
You can let go of it.

1085
01:28:05,609 --> 01:28:08,271
All right, just back away.
just back away!

1086
01:28:08,378 --> 01:28:12,041
Sir, morgue team
has not checked in.

1087
01:28:14,218 --> 01:28:16,311
Blackbird One,
it's Blackbird, over.

1088
01:28:16,420 --> 01:28:21,221
Blackbird One, this is Blackbird.
Come in, goddamn it!

1089
01:28:23,393 --> 01:28:26,954
Somebody's still there.
Let's move!

1090
01:28:27,064 --> 01:28:29,396
Rats alive! Close on the morgue!
Close on the morgue!

1091
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:31,491
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go!

1092
01:28:31,602 --> 01:28:35,003
Frye, Darrow, hustle up.
We got more company!

1093
01:28:38,575 --> 01:28:43,308
Hold it! Converge
on the morgue! Move out!

1094
01:28:43,413 --> 01:28:46,746
Goodspeed, come on.
Come over here.

1095
01:28:46,850 --> 01:28:50,308
Yeah, I love pressure,
I eat it for breakfast.

1096
01:28:50,420 --> 01:28:52,047
Come on. Time's up.

1097
01:28:52,155 --> 01:28:55,352
There's three rockets somewhere else.
We have to find them!

1098
01:28:57,794 --> 01:29:00,320
Come on!

1099
01:29:17,714 --> 01:29:19,204
Clear!

1100
01:29:22,286 --> 01:29:25,687
- I'm too old for this!
- Where's it go?.

1101
01:29:25,789 --> 01:29:27,950
I've no idea.

1102
01:29:28,058 --> 01:29:30,652
Sir, all the guidance
chips are gone.

1103
01:29:30,761 --> 01:29:33,753
Captain, I guess you didn't quite
take care of the rat problem.

1104
01:29:33,864 --> 01:29:35,331
No, sir.

1105
01:29:35,432 --> 01:29:38,333
Well, there are two dead men who
strongly suggest you go finish the job.

1106
01:29:38,435 --> 01:29:40,995
Yes, sir. Yes, sir!

1107
01:29:49,313 --> 01:29:52,942
- You really don't know where this goes?.
- No, I don't know where it goes.

1108
01:29:53,050 --> 01:29:56,315
Well, we're picking up speed.
Do you know how to slow it down?.

1109
01:29:56,420 --> 01:29:57,887
No, I don't.

1110
01:30:06,530 --> 01:30:08,862
Aaaaaaah!

1111
01:30:10,534 --> 01:30:13,332
Uhhh!

1112
01:30:24,481 --> 01:30:26,108
God!

1113
01:30:33,390 --> 01:30:37,622
Mason! You all right?.

1114
01:30:37,728 --> 01:30:41,255
Yes, perfectly okay,
you fucking idiot.

1115
01:30:43,233 --> 01:30:45,292
They're coming.

1116
01:30:45,402 --> 01:30:47,962
- Who?.
- The marines!

1117
01:30:48,071 --> 01:30:49,197
Where?.

1118
01:31:51,234 --> 01:31:54,499
- What the fuck's goin' on?.
- Let's cut him off.

1119
01:32:17,894 --> 01:32:19,156
Mason!

1120
01:32:22,733 --> 01:32:25,031
Mason!

1121
01:33:40,243 --> 01:33:45,772
You motherfucker, die, die, die!

1122
01:34:06,203 --> 01:34:09,604
I'm rather glad
you didn't hesitate too long.

1123
01:34:12,676 --> 01:34:16,635
How do you do it?.

1124
01:34:16,746 --> 01:34:22,412
Oh, I was trained by the best.
British Intelligence.

1125
01:34:22,519 --> 01:34:25,352
Come on.

1126
01:34:25,455 --> 01:34:30,483
But in retrospect, I'd rather
have been a poet or a farmer.

1127
01:34:30,594 --> 01:34:32,653
Okay.

1128
01:34:36,766 --> 01:34:40,099
Okay, the president
arrives in three hours.

1129
01:34:40,203 --> 01:34:44,401
His directive is to string Hummel along
until the air strike is operational.

1130
01:34:44,507 --> 01:34:46,600
What's the word
from Mojave, General?.

1131
01:34:46,710 --> 01:34:51,670
Same as last time, Lou.
They're going as fast as they can.

1132
01:34:55,785 --> 01:35:00,154
Do it over here.
On your knees.

1133
01:35:10,100 --> 01:35:13,399
Navy SEALS, listen up.
You've got something that belongs to me.

1134
01:35:13,503 --> 01:35:15,937
Twelve guidance chips,
to be precise.

1135
01:35:16,039 --> 01:35:20,669
Let me remind you that there are lives
at stake, civilian lives.

1136
01:35:20,777 --> 01:35:22,506
Speak up.

1137
01:35:22,612 --> 01:35:25,547
- Speak up!
- Oh! I, uh-

1138
01:35:25,649 --> 01:35:27,549
- Uh-
- Tell them your name.

1139
01:35:27,651 --> 01:35:29,812
My name is Larry Henderson.

1140
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:31,581
Oh, man.

1141
01:35:31,688 --> 01:35:34,521
And I'm a father
of three, and, uh,

1142
01:35:34,624 --> 01:35:37,422
they've got a gun to my head.

1143
01:35:37,527 --> 01:35:41,327
You've got exactly three minutes
to return the guidance chips,

1144
01:35:41,431 --> 01:35:44,127
or Mr. Henderson
won't have a head.

1145
01:35:44,234 --> 01:35:46,998
Oh, no. Hey, what-?.

1146
01:35:47,103 --> 01:35:52,973
Now, three to go.
You find them and defuse them.

1147
01:35:53,076 --> 01:35:57,012
- Okay?. All right.
- All right.

1148
01:35:57,113 --> 01:36:00,446
I'll try and delay Hummel
and give you more time.

1149
01:36:00,550 --> 01:36:03,713
Hey, what about
Mr. Henderson's head?.

1150
01:36:05,889 --> 01:36:08,858
Okay. What do you mean?.

1151
01:36:13,763 --> 01:36:15,253
Okay.

1152
01:36:28,478 --> 01:36:31,936
- General.
- Who the hell are you?.

1153
01:36:33,850 --> 01:36:36,216
I'm all that's left
of the enemy.

1154
01:36:50,300 --> 01:36:51,892
Bingo.

1155
01:37:00,744 --> 01:37:02,644
Stand easy.

1156
01:37:05,382 --> 01:37:09,751
Thought I'd been
in the service a long time.

1157
01:37:09,853 --> 01:37:14,051
- Name and rank, sailor.
- It's army, actually.

1158
01:37:14,157 --> 01:37:18,389
Answer the question.
And address him as "General, sir. "

1159
01:37:19,596 --> 01:37:22,793
Captain John Patrick Mason,
General, sir...

1160
01:37:22,899 --> 01:37:24,992
of Her Majesty's S.A.S.

1161
01:37:25,101 --> 01:37:26,796
Retired, of course.

1162
01:37:30,707 --> 01:37:33,437
You're a long way
from home, Captain.

1163
01:37:33,543 --> 01:37:36,205
How the hell are you
involved in this?.

1164
01:37:36,312 --> 01:37:38,940
I have a unique knowledge
of this prison facility.

1165
01:37:39,049 --> 01:37:42,018
I was, uh...
formerly a guest here.

1166
01:37:55,965 --> 01:37:58,525
Hi, sweetie.

1167
01:38:05,275 --> 01:38:07,800
Hey, come back here,
little boy.

1168
01:38:09,679 --> 01:38:12,580
Did they bother to tell you
who I am, why I'm doing this,

1169
01:38:12,682 --> 01:38:15,674
or are they just using you
like they do everybody else?.

1170
01:38:15,785 --> 01:38:19,551
All I know is you were big in Vietnam.
I saw the highlights on television.

1171
01:38:19,656 --> 01:38:23,353
You wouldn't have any idea what it means to
lead the finest men on God's earth into battle,

1172
01:38:23,460 --> 01:38:25,724
and then see their memory betrayed
by their own fuckin' government!

1173
01:38:25,829 --> 01:38:30,732
I don't quite see how you cherish the memory
of the dead by killing another million.

1174
01:38:30,834 --> 01:38:34,668
And, uh...
this is not combat.

1175
01:38:34,771 --> 01:38:39,037
It's an act of lunacy,
General, sir.

1176
01:38:39,142 --> 01:38:41,838
Personally, I think
you're a fuckin' idiot.

1177
01:38:48,118 --> 01:38:50,712
"The tree of liberty must be refreshed
from time to time...

1178
01:38:50,820 --> 01:38:54,119
"with the blood of patriots
and tyrants. " Thomas Jefferson.

1179
01:38:54,224 --> 01:38:59,025
" Patriotism is the virtue of
the vicious," according to Oscar Wilde.

1180
01:39:04,033 --> 01:39:06,024
Thank you for making my point.

1181
01:39:06,136 --> 01:39:10,470
Where are the guidance chips?.
Where are the guidance chips!

1182
01:39:10,573 --> 01:39:12,803
I destroyed them.

1183
01:39:12,909 --> 01:39:14,774
That was a bad move, soldier.

1184
01:39:14,878 --> 01:39:17,813
Does that mean
you'll execute us both?.

1185
01:39:45,708 --> 01:39:49,269
You're lucky that old man
Hummel wants you alive.

1186
01:39:49,379 --> 01:39:51,574
'Cause I'd take pleasure
in guttin' you, boy.

1187
01:39:58,254 --> 01:40:03,385
I'd take pleasure
in guttin' you... boy.

1188
01:40:03,493 --> 01:40:08,988
I'll take pleasure
in guttin' you... boy.

1189
01:40:09,098 --> 01:40:10,963
What is wrong with these
people, huh, Mason?.

1190
01:40:11,067 --> 01:40:15,163
Don't you think there's a lot of, uh,
anger floatin' around this island?

1191
01:40:15,271 --> 01:40:18,502
Kind of a pubescent volatility?.
Don't you think?.

1192
01:40:18,608 --> 01:40:22,806
A lot of angst, lot of " I'm 16;
I'm angry at my father" syndrome?.

1193
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:25,244
I mean, grow up!
We're stuck on an island...

1194
01:40:25,348 --> 01:40:28,283
with a bunch of violence-for-pleasure
seeking psychopathic marines.

1195
01:40:28,384 --> 01:40:31,046
Shame on them!

1196
01:40:33,423 --> 01:40:36,654
Anyway, I only got one chem rod,
and there's two left.

1197
01:40:36,759 --> 01:40:38,317
Mason?

1198
01:40:38,428 --> 01:40:40,794
Yes, I'm here.

1199
01:40:40,897 --> 01:40:43,559
I was just thinking
how wonderful it was...

1200
01:40:43,666 --> 01:40:46,157
when the inmates weren't
allowed to talk in here.

1201
01:40:46,269 --> 01:40:48,965
Not allowed to talk.

1202
01:40:49,072 --> 01:40:51,165
How did you do it?

1203
01:40:51,274 --> 01:40:56,007
Nurtured the hope that there was hope...

1204
01:40:56,112 --> 01:40:59,604
that one day I’d breathe free air.

1205
01:40:59,716 --> 01:41:03,049
Perhaps meet my daughter.

1206
01:41:03,152 --> 01:41:07,612
Modest hopes,
but they kept a man alive.

1207
01:41:07,724 --> 01:41:10,818
What did they put you away for, John?

1208
01:41:10,927 --> 01:41:13,589
Oh, that's a long story.

1209
01:41:13,696 --> 01:41:16,256
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

1210
01:41:16,366 --> 01:41:19,995
When was the last communication
from our men on Alcatraz?.

1211
01:41:20,103 --> 01:41:22,333
Seven hours.

1212
01:41:24,807 --> 01:41:28,106
- Thermite plasma is operational.
- Get me the president.

1213
01:41:28,211 --> 01:41:32,807
Be seated. Gentlemen,
consider yourselves on ground alert.

1214
01:41:32,915 --> 01:41:35,383
If we receive launch authority,
your mission is...

1215
01:41:35,485 --> 01:41:37,783
the complete thermal destruction
of Alcatraz Island.

1216
01:41:37,887 --> 01:41:42,051
The entire island is to be blanketed,
not one square inch missed.

1217
01:41:42,158 --> 01:41:47,391
81 American civilians and a number
of U.S. Marines will lose their lives.

1218
01:41:49,165 --> 01:41:54,467
Why didn't you just tell them where the
microfilm was and create a solution?

1219
01:41:54,570 --> 01:41:59,530
The moment they had the
microfilm, they'd suicide me.

1220
01:41:59,642 --> 01:42:02,770
- Some solution.
- You ended up here.

1221
01:42:02,879 --> 01:42:06,337
Which brings me
to another question.

1222
01:42:06,449 --> 01:42:09,885
You broke out- let me see
if I can get this straight-

1223
01:42:09,986 --> 01:42:13,979
you went down the incinerator
chute, on the mine car,

1224
01:42:14,090 --> 01:42:17,082
through the tunnels
to the power plant,

1225
01:42:17,193 --> 01:42:20,629
under the steam engine-
that was really cool, by the way-

1226
01:42:20,730 --> 01:42:23,927
and into the cistern
through the intake pipe,

1227
01:42:24,033 --> 01:42:28,732
but how, in the name of Zeus’s butthole,

1228
01:42:28,838 --> 01:42:30,829
did you get out of your cell?.

1229
01:42:30,940 --> 01:42:34,467
I only ask because
in our current situation,

1230
01:42:34,577 --> 01:42:40,413
well, it could prove to be
useful information, maybe!

1231
01:42:58,134 --> 01:43:01,001
Trade secrets, my son.

1232
01:43:02,805 --> 01:43:04,204
Wow.

1233
01:43:04,340 --> 01:43:06,774
General, two operational
rockets left.

1234
01:43:06,876 --> 01:43:09,242
One at the lower lighthouse
and one at the roof.

1235
01:43:09,345 --> 01:43:13,406
Both of the birds are ready to fly, sir.
General, can you hear me?

1236
01:43:13,516 --> 01:43:16,576
- I heard you, Captain.
- Just makin' sure.

1237
01:43:18,221 --> 01:43:21,190
Should we... prepare
for launch, General?

1238
01:43:22,492 --> 01:43:26,553
- I'll handle the strategy, Captain.
- Yes, sir.

1239
01:43:26,662 --> 01:43:31,759
The hour is approaching, sir. Just
letting the General know of the time.

1240
01:43:31,868 --> 01:43:33,802
I'm very aware
of the time, Captain.

1241
01:43:33,903 --> 01:43:36,201
Aye, aye, sir.
Lettin' you know.

1242
01:43:36,305 --> 01:43:38,967
Me and my boys are cocked,
locked and ready to rock.

1243
01:43:41,277 --> 01:43:43,404
Mason, where are you going?.

1244
01:43:43,513 --> 01:43:46,414
Thirty years ago I vowed
I wouldn't die in this toilet.

1245
01:43:46,516 --> 01:43:50,850
You're not leaving! There's a madman
in there with his hand on a button!

1246
01:43:50,953 --> 01:43:54,719
Shhh. Some sniper's
gonna get his ass.

1247
01:43:54,824 --> 01:43:57,520
Stop moving, Mason.

1248
01:43:58,961 --> 01:44:01,521
Mason, stop moving.

1249
01:44:01,631 --> 01:44:04,862
Hummel won't do it.
He's a soldier, not a murderer.

1250
01:44:04,967 --> 01:44:07,197
I read it in his eyes.

1251
01:44:07,303 --> 01:44:10,966
Read his eyes?. Oh, well,
then everything's just fine!

1252
01:44:11,073 --> 01:44:14,270
- I can't afford to take that chance.
- Why don't you talk louder?.

1253
01:44:14,377 --> 01:44:16,902
Three minutes to go, sir.

1254
01:44:18,714 --> 01:44:21,615
- They're not gonna call for it.
- Oh, they'll call.

1255
01:44:21,717 --> 01:44:25,050
They'll call if we fire
one of our rockets up their ass.

1256
01:44:25,154 --> 01:44:28,123
Sir.

1257
01:44:32,829 --> 01:44:35,627
- Hummel.
- Hi, Frank, it's Al Kramer here.

1258
01:44:35,731 --> 01:44:38,564
- How's it going out there?.
- How do you think it's going?.

1259
01:44:38,668 --> 01:44:42,331
- We're gonna need another hour, Frank.
- You've got three minutes.

1260
01:44:42,438 --> 01:44:46,568
- We have to get authorization from the president.
- You've got three minutes.

1261
01:44:46,676 --> 01:44:50,134
Frank, please
don't do anything stupid.

1262
01:44:50,246 --> 01:44:53,977
They want another hour.

1263
01:44:54,083 --> 01:44:57,416
That's bullshit. That's bullshit,
General. They're lying.

1264
01:44:57,520 --> 01:45:01,616
They're calling our bluff., sir.
They're playing you for a fool.

1265
01:45:01,724 --> 01:45:06,821
Sir, order the launch, General.

1266
01:45:06,929 --> 01:45:10,490
Come on, General,
let's be all we can be.

1267
01:45:24,914 --> 01:45:27,041
The mission's not complete!

1268
01:45:27,149 --> 01:45:29,083
Well, mine is.

1269
01:45:29,185 --> 01:45:31,881
When this is over,
you'll go back home,

1270
01:45:31,988 --> 01:45:36,721
driving Carla and your baby
insane in your beige Volvo.

1271
01:45:36,826 --> 01:45:40,387
And I'll be dead, or back in prison
which is the same thing.

1272
01:45:40,496 --> 01:45:44,865
You're not leaving.

1273
01:45:47,303 --> 01:45:51,296
All right...
I'll do it myself.

1274
01:45:52,475 --> 01:45:54,636
I got three weeks'
weapons training.

1275
01:45:54,744 --> 01:45:59,078
I'll kick the-
And a platoon full of marines.

1276
01:45:59,181 --> 01:46:01,945
No problem.

1277
01:46:12,929 --> 01:46:16,228
- Major, patch me into roof battery.
- Aye, sir.

1278
01:46:16,332 --> 01:46:20,234
Fire open control circuit
coordinates to the roof, sir.

1279
01:46:20,336 --> 01:46:22,736
Let's go!

1280
01:46:28,077 --> 01:46:31,872
- Laser powered up.
- Oh, no.

1281
01:46:31,981 --> 01:46:34,814
I said, on your knees!

1282
01:46:34,917 --> 01:46:37,408
My name's Stanley Goodspeed.

1283
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:40,455
I'm a chemical weapons
specialist for the FBI.

1284
01:46:40,556 --> 01:46:42,490
- Uh, glass or plastic?.
- What?.

1285
01:46:42,592 --> 01:46:45,117
- Glass or plastic!
- Shut the fuck up!

1286
01:46:45,227 --> 01:46:48,719
Because if the winds change and if you
launch those rockets, we're gonna die.

1287
01:46:48,831 --> 01:46:50,059
Shut up!

1288
01:46:50,166 --> 01:46:54,000
And you're gonna end up
in a glass jar or a plastic bag.

1289
01:46:54,103 --> 01:46:59,200
So do the math, hand over the gun
and let's go find some rockets!

1290
01:46:59,308 --> 01:47:02,607
I said shut the fuck-

1291
01:47:07,316 --> 01:47:10,911
You made the right choice.

1292
01:47:11,020 --> 01:47:15,184
I decided I didn't want your child
growing up without a father.

1293
01:47:15,291 --> 01:47:18,590
Hey, the last time I swam
this channel, I was your age.

1294
01:47:18,694 --> 01:47:21,686
So I'm fucked either way.
So come on.

1295
01:47:21,797 --> 01:47:24,630
The weapon is hot.
I am standing by for the launch command.

1296
01:47:24,734 --> 01:47:28,261
Man, killing Navy Seals is one thing-
Is this for real?.

1297
01:47:28,371 --> 01:47:30,999
Hey, it's business.

1298
01:47:33,643 --> 01:47:36,237
Access code entered.
Weapon available for release.

1299
01:47:36,345 --> 01:47:38,245
Launch coordinates:

1300
01:47:38,347 --> 01:47:42,545
six, seven, five, four, five, niner.

1301
01:47:44,253 --> 01:47:46,414
The weapon is hot.

1302
01:47:46,522 --> 01:47:49,423
I'm standing by
for launch command.

1303
01:47:49,525 --> 01:47:51,425
It's affirmative.

1304
01:47:57,900 --> 01:48:00,391
Standing by for command.

1305
01:48:08,377 --> 01:48:10,937
I'm waiting for
a launch command, General.

1306
01:48:19,021 --> 01:48:21,012
- Fire.
- Fire!

1307
01:48:26,929 --> 01:48:29,193
Missile loose!
Missile loose!

1308
01:48:34,770 --> 01:48:39,332
Origin: Alcatraz, 67253725.

1309
01:48:39,442 --> 01:48:43,469
- What's the heading?.
- Heading 185 degrees south southeast.

1310
01:48:43,579 --> 01:48:47,106
- Speed?.
- 300 knots. Headed right at Oakland.

1311
01:48:47,216 --> 01:48:48,808
The football game.

1312
01:48:52,755 --> 01:48:54,518
Oh, my God.

1313
01:49:17,480 --> 01:49:19,345
Missile radically
changing direction.

1314
01:49:25,654 --> 01:49:30,091
New direction: 275 degrees west.
It's headed out to sea, sir.

1315
01:49:30,192 --> 01:49:32,422
Oh, Christ!

1316
01:49:33,929 --> 01:49:37,831
Missile losing altitude.
Falling.

1317
01:49:37,933 --> 01:49:41,300
Falling, 300 feet, 200, 100.

1318
01:49:44,540 --> 01:49:47,441
Bogey detonated underwater.

1319
01:49:49,812 --> 01:49:51,871
What the fuck?.

1320
01:49:51,981 --> 01:49:55,314
- It missed.
- Well, that's great.

1321
01:49:55,417 --> 01:49:58,944
Extremely great,
but there's still one left.

1322
01:49:59,054 --> 01:50:02,751
What happened to the rocket?
What the fuck happened?

1323
01:50:02,858 --> 01:50:06,225
What the fuck is going on
to the coordinates?. Sir! Major!

1324
01:50:06,328 --> 01:50:08,728
Captain, step outside.

1325
01:50:08,831 --> 01:50:11,527
- Talk to me, sir.
- Captain, step outside!

1326
01:50:25,014 --> 01:50:27,209
Get me the Pentagon.

1327
01:50:40,062 --> 01:50:42,428
What the hell was that, Frank?.

1328
01:50:44,333 --> 01:50:47,666
- I said, what the hell-
- I heard what you said!

1329
01:50:47,770 --> 01:50:50,739
- I'd appreciate a little more respect.
- Cut the crap, General.

1330
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:53,104
- What the hell are you doing?.
- I'm not ready to kill these people.

1331
01:50:53,209 --> 01:50:55,234
- Call the Pentagon. Ask for more time.
- No.

1332
01:50:55,344 --> 01:50:58,404
Do it, Frank!
We're coming loose.

1333
01:50:58,514 --> 01:51:01,608
You're coming loose.
The rest of us are in complete control.

1334
01:51:01,717 --> 01:51:04,652
- We're gonna ask for a new deadline.
- Put the phone down.

1335
01:51:04,753 --> 01:51:07,278
- The men are falling apart!
- The men are marines!

1336
01:51:07,389 --> 01:51:11,348
Are they?.
I wanna talk to Gen. Kramer.

1337
01:51:11,460 --> 01:51:14,190
- You've been asked by an old friend.
- Put him on the phone right now.

1338
01:51:14,296 --> 01:51:16,423
- You've been ordered.
- This is Major Baxter!

1339
01:51:16,532 --> 01:51:19,831
Now you're being given your last chance
by a man with a gun.

1340
01:51:19,935 --> 01:51:22,096
Put the phone down.

1341
01:51:24,673 --> 01:51:29,007
- I thought you weren't ready to kill.
- I'm warming up.

1342
01:51:29,111 --> 01:51:31,238
At ease.

1343
01:51:39,889 --> 01:51:42,983
They need a decision,
Mr. President.

1344
01:51:48,964 --> 01:51:52,866
These past few hours...

1345
01:51:52,968 --> 01:51:57,234
have been the longest,
darkest of my life.

1346
01:51:57,339 --> 01:52:00,934
How does one weigh human life?

1347
01:52:02,278 --> 01:52:05,736
One million civilians
against 81 hostages.

1348
01:52:05,848 --> 01:52:09,181
And in the middle, Frank Hummel.

1349
01:52:09,285 --> 01:52:13,517
That we have ignored, abandoned...

1350
01:52:13,622 --> 01:52:17,991
or marginalized a great
soldier like Frank Hummel,

1351
01:52:18,093 --> 01:52:21,256
and American boys have paid
for that neglect...

1352
01:52:21,363 --> 01:52:24,764
with blood is equally real...

1353
01:52:24,867 --> 01:52:27,267
and equally tragic.

1354
01:52:29,772 --> 01:52:31,933
We are at war with terror,

1355
01:52:32,041 --> 01:52:35,602
and fighting war means casualties.

1356
01:52:35,711 --> 01:52:39,169
This is the worst call
I've ever had to make.

1357
01:52:43,319 --> 01:52:46,755
Air strike approved.

1358
01:52:49,058 --> 01:52:51,049
Red Thunder to Tower.
Request clearance.

1359
01:52:51,160 --> 01:52:54,493
The amount of firepower
they're gonna drop in there-

1360
01:52:54,596 --> 01:52:57,724
- This is strike leader. Prepared to go.
- It'll be over in a few seconds.

1361
01:52:57,833 --> 01:53:00,631
Flight time to drop point: 17 minutes.

1362
01:53:07,209 --> 01:53:10,542
Excuse me, General, sir,
with all due respect to you.

1363
01:53:10,646 --> 01:53:13,444
- What the fuck is going on?.
- You changed the coordinates, didn't you, General?.

1364
01:53:13,549 --> 01:53:16,780
- That's affirmative, Captain.
- So now they think we’re gutless?.

1365
01:53:16,885 --> 01:53:19,547
The Feds?.
They think we won't actually do it.

1366
01:53:19,655 --> 01:53:22,453
They're gonna come at us with
everything they got. Air and sea.

1367
01:53:22,558 --> 01:53:24,890
They're gonna bomb our ass
back to the Stone Age.

1368
01:53:24,994 --> 01:53:26,985
They don't know
we missed on purpose.

1369
01:53:27,096 --> 01:53:32,398
Great. We're not gutless.
We're incompetent. That right?.

1370
01:53:32,501 --> 01:53:35,902
I don't think I like your tone, Captain.
We planned for this contingency.

1371
01:53:36,005 --> 01:53:38,997
Load the V.X. into the choppers,
take four hostages and evacuate.

1372
01:53:39,108 --> 01:53:41,338
The consequences of our actions
I'll face alone.

1373
01:53:41,443 --> 01:53:44,640
Excuse me, General, but
what about the fucking money?.

1374
01:53:44,747 --> 01:53:47,215
There is no fucking money.
Mission's over.

1375
01:53:47,316 --> 01:53:49,079
Bullshit it's over.

1376
01:53:49,184 --> 01:53:52,711
You're talking to a General, soldier!
Maintain discipline!

1377
01:53:52,821 --> 01:53:57,485
I'm not a soldier, Major. The day
we took hostages, we became mercenaries.

1378
01:53:57,593 --> 01:54:02,394
And mercenaries get paid.
I want my fucking money!

1379
01:54:02,498 --> 01:54:05,058
This mission was based
on the threat of force.

1380
01:54:05,167 --> 01:54:08,830
I'm not about to kill
80,000 innocent people.

1381
01:54:08,937 --> 01:54:12,270
Do you think I'm
out of my fucking mind?.

1382
01:54:12,374 --> 01:54:15,400
We bluffed. They called it.
The mission's over.

1383
01:54:18,881 --> 01:54:21,543
Who ever said anything
about bluffing, General?.

1384
01:54:21,650 --> 01:54:24,448
Stand down, Captain.

1385
01:54:29,091 --> 01:54:32,219
Stand down, Captain!

1386
01:54:36,865 --> 01:54:41,632
Major, I'm ordering you to take
these men to the choppers and evacuate.

1387
01:54:41,737 --> 01:54:45,138
That's a simple order, Major!

1388
01:54:45,240 --> 01:54:47,367
It's not so simple, Frank.

1389
01:54:47,476 --> 01:54:52,175
Sgt. Crisp, secure the general.

1390
01:54:52,281 --> 01:54:55,250
I'm relieving you
of your command, sir.

1391
01:54:59,021 --> 01:55:01,785
Sergeant!

1392
01:55:08,330 --> 01:55:11,424
- I'll have that sidearm, sir.
- You mean this sidearm?.

1393
01:55:20,375 --> 01:55:23,811
Maj. Baxter, you're either with us
or against us.

1394
01:55:29,384 --> 01:55:33,411
It has been the greatest honor
of my life to serve with you, General.

1395
01:55:37,626 --> 01:55:42,791
But like he said... it's over.

1396
01:56:00,315 --> 01:56:02,476
Let's get him.

1397
01:56:07,556 --> 01:56:10,184
Mason!

1398
01:56:11,326 --> 01:56:14,124
My God, what have I done?.

1399
01:56:14,229 --> 01:56:18,063
Where's the last rocket?.
Where's the last rocket!

1400
01:56:19,835 --> 01:56:22,804
- Where's the last rocket?.
- Lower lighthouse.

1401
01:56:22,905 --> 01:56:25,567
- Lower lighthouse!
- Go.

1402
01:56:37,986 --> 01:56:41,717
Darrow, go to the lighthouse!
I'll take care of this fucker!

1403
01:56:48,030 --> 01:56:50,658
One, two, three!

1404
01:56:50,766 --> 01:56:52,233
Eat that!

1405
01:57:06,648 --> 01:57:08,081
Did it.

1406
01:57:39,147 --> 01:57:42,913
Come here. Come here,
you little chickensh-

1407
01:57:43,018 --> 01:57:46,476
You shoot me, I drop this.
We're both dead.

1408
01:57:46,588 --> 01:57:49,318
Come on. Come on.
Don't be scared. I won't hurt you.

1409
01:57:49,424 --> 01:57:51,619
- Come on.
- You know how this shit works?.

1410
01:57:51,727 --> 01:57:53,854
You know how this shit works?.

1411
01:57:56,365 --> 01:57:59,960
Come on.

1412
01:58:00,068 --> 01:58:02,161
I don't need a gun.
I'll put it down.

1413
01:58:02,271 --> 01:58:06,605
Come on. Let's play.
Come on. Come on.

1414
01:58:06,708 --> 01:58:11,338
Listen, I think we got started off
on the wrong foot. Stan Goodspeed, FBI.

1415
01:58:11,446 --> 01:58:14,643
Uh, let's talk music. Do you like
the Elton John song, "Rocket Man"?

1416
01:58:14,750 --> 01:58:19,084
- I don't like soft-ass shit.
- Oh, you- Oh, oh.

1417
01:58:19,187 --> 01:58:24,318
Well, I only bring it up because,
uh, it's you. You're the Rocket Man.

1418
01:58:31,300 --> 01:58:33,359
How do you like
how that shit works?.

1419
01:58:33,468 --> 01:58:35,493
Second rocket's away!

1420
01:58:43,312 --> 01:58:45,371
It splashed into the bay, sir.
No detonation.

1421
01:58:45,480 --> 01:58:47,311
Shit.

1422
01:59:08,337 --> 01:59:09,998
Darrow!

1423
01:59:11,406 --> 01:59:13,306
Open up!

1424
01:59:16,244 --> 01:59:17,871
Come on.

1425
01:59:17,979 --> 01:59:19,708
Open up!

1426
01:59:48,477 --> 01:59:51,275
Hey, you mothe-e-e-er!

1427
02:00:24,780 --> 02:00:28,113
Oh, I'm gonna
get you now, baby.

1428
02:00:30,919 --> 02:00:33,513
Okay.

1429
02:00:34,890 --> 02:00:37,290
Got ya. I got you, baby.

1430
02:00:37,392 --> 02:00:39,656
Come on.

1431
02:00:57,045 --> 02:00:59,104
Fucker!

1432
02:01:25,040 --> 02:01:29,534
Red Thunder strike leader.
Time on target: seven minutes.

1433
02:01:45,927 --> 02:01:49,795
English prick.
I tell you my old man was Irish?.

1434
02:01:52,634 --> 02:01:55,398
Maintain air speed
4-5-0 knots.

1435
02:02:00,008 --> 02:02:02,203
Aw, fuck!

1436
02:02:21,363 --> 02:02:23,923
It's me and you, pal!

1437
02:02:24,032 --> 02:02:26,694
I want that fucking chip!

1438
02:02:36,044 --> 02:02:38,035
I love pressure.

1439
02:02:45,353 --> 02:02:48,720
I know you're in here,
and I know you can hear me.

1440
02:02:48,823 --> 02:02:51,758
Now pay the piper
and come out like a man.

1441
02:03:21,723 --> 02:03:23,714
Increase speed to 5-0-0 knots.

1442
02:03:23,825 --> 02:03:27,261
You motherfucker!

1443
02:03:31,266 --> 02:03:35,259
I'm gonna choke my million bucks
out of you! You're gonna die!

1444
02:03:35,370 --> 02:03:38,237
Eat that, you fucker!

1445
02:04:06,601 --> 02:04:10,093
All right, team inbound.
Time on target: 60 seconds.

1446
02:04:14,109 --> 02:04:18,068
On course heading 1-4-2 degrees.

1447
02:04:25,820 --> 02:04:27,981
When he neutralizes the threat,

1448
02:04:28,089 --> 02:04:31,183
we launch green flares
and we wait for the cavalry.

1449
02:04:35,930 --> 02:04:39,627
- Let's tighten up that formation.
- May God have mercy on your souls.

1450
02:04:39,734 --> 02:04:42,897
Please don't let this happen.
There has to be something you can do.

1451
02:04:53,581 --> 02:04:56,573
Let's drop to the deck,
100 feet below radar.

1452
02:05:06,695 --> 02:05:09,095
Target acquired.
Rolling in.

1453
02:05:12,500 --> 02:05:15,264
This is Red Thunder.
Master arm.

1454
02:05:15,370 --> 02:05:17,668
Master armed.

1455
02:05:17,772 --> 02:05:20,263
Time on target: 12 seconds.

1456
02:05:22,811 --> 02:05:25,905
ten seconds.
- Please.

1457
02:05:30,018 --> 02:05:31,918
Stay tight, gentlemen.

1458
02:05:34,255 --> 02:05:36,689
I got green smoke.
I got green smoke!

1459
02:05:36,791 --> 02:05:40,124
This is CQ-1, CQ-1. Green smoke!
We have green smoke, over!

1460
02:05:40,228 --> 02:05:42,355
- Gimme that, gimme that. Abort.
- Abort!

1461
02:05:42,464 --> 02:05:45,228
- Flight leader, abort, abort!
- Jesus Christ!

1462
02:05:47,469 --> 02:05:50,097
I already dropped 'em.

1463
02:05:59,147 --> 02:06:00,944
Oh, goddamn it!

1464
02:06:02,083 --> 02:06:05,075
Oh, my God.

1465
02:06:05,186 --> 02:06:08,815
Get out of my way.
Let me through, please. Let me through.

1466
02:06:11,893 --> 02:06:17,160
The cells did not get hit.
The bombs hit on the back of the island.

1467
02:06:38,987 --> 02:06:41,922
I'm fed up saving your ass.

1468
02:06:42,023 --> 02:06:44,150
I'm amazed you ever
got past puberty.

1469
02:06:44,259 --> 02:06:49,253
I suppose all this will make
a great bedtime story to tell your kid.

1470
02:06:49,364 --> 02:06:52,197
You're insane, Mason.
The kid will have nightmares.

1471
02:06:52,300 --> 02:06:54,700
I'll spend all my money
on shrinks.

1472
02:06:54,803 --> 02:07:00,366
Goodspeed, come in. Goodspeed,
Goodspeed, do you read me? Come in.

1473
02:07:00,475 --> 02:07:02,409
Scanning all radio frequencies.

1474
02:07:02,510 --> 02:07:04,774
Goodspeed, do you read me?.
Come in.

1475
02:07:04,879 --> 02:07:09,009
Goodspeed, do you read me?. Come in.

1476
02:07:14,088 --> 02:07:18,115
Goodspeed?.
Do you read me?. Come in.

1477
02:07:18,226 --> 02:07:19,818
This is Goodspeed.

1478
02:07:22,063 --> 02:07:25,396
Are the hostages alive?.

1479
02:07:25,500 --> 02:07:27,491
Every one of ‘em.

1480
02:07:30,338 --> 02:07:34,798
Goodspeed, it's Womack.
What about Mason?.

1481
02:07:42,317 --> 02:07:44,217
He's dead, sir.

1482
02:07:44,319 --> 02:07:48,153
- How?. When?.
- Just come and get me.

1483
02:07:50,658 --> 02:07:52,683
Womack tore up your pardon, John.

1484
02:07:52,794 --> 02:07:56,491
But of course. I knew he would.

1485
02:07:56,598 --> 02:07:59,897
The S.D.U.s and the scuba gear
should still be where we came ashore.

1486
02:08:00,001 --> 02:08:02,265
If you can get
to the Pan Pacific Hotel,

1487
02:08:02,370 --> 02:08:04,736
there's clothes in my closet
and $200 in the bible.

1488
02:08:04,839 --> 02:08:06,739
Room 26.

1489
02:08:06,841 --> 02:08:11,710
Well, it's been a long time
since I've said thank you to anybody.

1490
02:08:11,813 --> 02:08:14,304
But thank you.

1491
02:08:16,517 --> 02:08:21,511
Well, Stanley, uh, this is when we go
our separate ways, huh?.

1492
02:08:23,124 --> 02:08:27,652
Uh- I'm sure you know the etymology
of your name, "Goodspeed. "

1493
02:08:27,762 --> 02:08:31,926
Yeah, "Godspeed. " To wish someone
a prosperous journey. Why?.

1494
02:08:32,033 --> 02:08:35,025
Well, if you fancy a journey,

1495
02:08:35,136 --> 02:08:38,970
I recommend Fort Walton, Kansas.

1496
02:08:39,073 --> 02:08:41,132
I was thinking of Maui.

1497
02:08:41,242 --> 02:08:43,233
No.

1498
02:08:47,916 --> 02:08:50,885
Forget Maui.

1499
02:08:56,291 --> 02:08:59,727
"St. Michael's Church,
Fort Walton, Kansas.

1500
02:08:59,827 --> 02:09:02,819
" Front pew, right leg.

1501
02:09:02,931 --> 02:09:05,161
Hollow. "

1502
02:09:05,266 --> 02:09:08,599
Is this what I think it is?.

1503
02:09:10,138 --> 02:09:12,766
Mason?.

1504
02:09:26,554 --> 02:09:29,819
-Congratulations, Dr.Goodspeed. You did it.
-Thank you, sir.

1505
02:09:29,924 --> 02:09:33,189
You know, for a while there,
I didn't think you were gonna make it.

1506
02:09:33,294 --> 02:09:36,957
Well done, son.
So, where's Mason?

1507
02:09:37,065 --> 02:09:41,161
Vaporized.
Blown out to sea.

1508
02:09:41,269 --> 02:09:43,601
Blown out to sea, huh?.

1509
02:09:43,705 --> 02:09:45,104
Yeah.

1510
02:09:45,206 --> 02:09:48,004
Poor bastard.

1511
02:09:51,379 --> 02:09:53,779
Goodspeed, where's Mason?.
Where's his body?.

1512
02:09:53,881 --> 02:09:56,349
I wanna see
that son of a bitch.

1513
02:09:56,451 --> 02:09:59,386
Vaporized, sir.
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1514
02:09:59,487 --> 02:10:04,789
What?. Vaporized?.
A body can vaporize?.

1515
02:10:04,892 --> 02:10:07,793
Oh, yeah.
Absolutely, sir.
